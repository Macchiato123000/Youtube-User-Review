tends to get caught on low lying branches and thicker brush that I walk through also I tend to go scouting in other areas besides my woods I dont hunt but my father does so I usually go into woods that could run for miles with him and when your walking for hours on end as you may know can be hard with nothing more then a small bag on your side. ¬†Heres the thing my bag has been out in the rain while I was at a lake near my house before so its seen much better days especially now that its strap is wearing out. ¬†Plus I fish and am a starting photographer so when I wouldnt be using the bag in the woods it will probably be holding lures weights a smaller net and some pliers of course. ¬†And its hard to take an entire bucket on the back of an ATV down to the lake when I want to fish somewhere other then my pond. ¬†Another issue is when I want to take one of our labs Tera with me then I need even more supplies such as extra water bottles dog food and some small bowls plus depending where we are going a leash and harness so I believe this bag would just make everything easier plus I havent read the Coyote book yet and have been wanting to considering how much I have loved animals and still do since I was just a little girl and even now as Im entering high school iv still never met an animal I have hated despite being lunged at by a a copperhead snake while I was watching my dog swim in the pond. ¬†Thank you so much for reading this and good luck to everyone!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.003613616626988201,

brought in by Coyote climbing the Sting Pain Index I stayed for the great personalities on the channel. Honestly I havent felt this connected to really good nature content since I was a kid growing up watching Steve Irwin and the Kratt brothers. The quality of the channel is incredible the shots are great the episodes are funny and informative. I came out of a really bad spot in my life last year which included being homeless in a tent in a foot of snow and when I look at myself now with my own apartment my cat a job and things I own and a great support network watching shows that make me feel good and help me learn more about the beauty of the world its a really good feeling. A couple months ago I even got a tattoo thats now a forest forearm sleeve thats going to go up into mountains and a night sky that just really celebrates the beauty of the West Coast.And what Id use the adventure pack for? Im not gonna lie to you - itll probably mostly be on display. Ive been collecting books of people I admire and supporting their work and the Brave Adventures book would totally look great in my meager but growing collection. But for the most part itll travel with me in the summer while I show my boyfriend and friend the beauty of my corner of Canadas Southwest coast. Gonna go to the aquarium and Science World and maybe the planetarium cruise Stanley Park head out on the ferry. Fun stuff where I could absolutely use the pack to carry water and snacks and other such things.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.030727989576611884, 0.9692720104233881))</td><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>1712429.0</td><td>all I did was play wrestle with my dog for the 5 years Ive owned her and she does go for the forearm. she knew what to do instantly.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.7045715656736397, 0.2954284343263603))</td><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>1777036.0</td><td>I have a dog named turtle.

She died in November and in March my cat who was only 14 years old got sick and passed away literally in two days. It was really weird because everything went terribly wrong when he got sick and it felt like he was destine to die. I was totally heartbroken. I missed him so much that for whatever reason i thought that if i would go to a shelter and adopt a cat that looks like him i would get my cat back. That was exactly what i did. I went to a few shelters and one of them had one large cat room where you could walk in and pet the cats they were offering for adoption. I went inside and petted a cat who looked very similar to the cat i had.  This cat looked at me and climbed on my shoulders. I put her back on a bench but she climbed on my shoulders again and  she was rubbing herself against my neck. People who worked at that shelter were literally stunned because she did not do that to anyone. I adopted her and brought her home. At first i was disappointed because in my disturbed mind at that time i thought that she would have the same personality as my deceased cat but her personality was completely different. As i got to know her better it totally hit me that she acts absolutely like my dog that passed away in November.  Everyone who knew that dog also noticed that.  I believe that this cat is actually my reincarnated dog. Her soul went to the body of this cat and she came back to me. By the way since i brought her home she never jumped on my shoulders like she did it in the shelter.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.10071395101060684, 0.8992860489893931))</td><td>Brent Atwater</td><td>770628.0</td><td>Thank you so much for your videos.

Ive always been non believer. I always felt guilty because Im convinced I didnt do enough for him and I scolded him sometimes for things that werent his fault. Soon after his death he started to visit me in my dreams. The first dream I had was horrible he looked fine and healthy but when I tried to pet him he turned skin and bones almost a skeleton. The following visits were better he stil looked old and dirty but he was always eating and he didnt look like he was suffering and I felt like he never died and he just returned from where I never realized in my dreams. Every time he visited me I always woke up crying and I went on crying for the whole following day I dont even know why.Its been a lot since the last time he visited me the last night I thought just that I havent seen my cat since a whole year now I would love if he could visit me again... and that night he visited me again stil looking sick but he was eating a lot and looking happy overall and it was like he never died. I knew in my dream that he was 26 years old and I kept saying we need to call the vet and get the surgery done this time or his condition will get worse... The vet will be very surprised on his improvements though he put on a lot of weight and he looks like a different cat from the last time the vet came... why did the vet came last time? He just looked at him and did nothing how weird (in reality the last time the vet came it was to put him down)... and that morning I wake up and started crying again and now I realized that my cat stopped visiting me because he didnt want to make me cry every time he showed up. Do you think its that the reason he didnt came more often?

And I dont mean adequately giving them the basics: food water etc. I mean when you get to the point that your attention can not be divided any further.  Its also a matter of whats important to you.  Somebody who spends their time at work out with friends shopping etc. would say holy shit you have too many pets how do you do it? I can do it because I WANT to give my extra time to them. Between classes? I dont go to the mall I take my dogs to a park.  Its all about whats important to you.  I want to come home and pet my cats.  Curl up in bed with a pile of fluff.  People say how can you afford it? Again. Its all about where you choose to put your money.  I would much rather spend my extra money on good dog food cat toys things for my snakes terrarium than on expensive clothes or shoes or makeup.  Id rather save money for vet appointments than vacations.  Its just. I donno. Its that animal loving gene you were talking about. Some people get it or they dont.  As for do you have too many pets?  You have too many when you start forgetting their names and oh yeah! I have a bearded dragon over here. If you have the time and WANT to greet and spend time with each of your pets at the shop.

Without thinking I flung open my door and greeted him with a big HEY FELLA what cha doing cmere!! and he barked just ONE HUGE BARK but didnt gesture towards me (like he was greeting me in response). He stood looking at me but also looking toward our back deck where 2 outdoor cats were watching his every move. He was more intrigued by them than me and half-trotted around back to investigate - but definitely not looking to kill them so I turned back inside and met him out the back porch door. By then the¬†cats disappeared so I proffered him a huge pot of beef stew Id intended to give the cats and he happily gobbled it up but since he was JET black and didnt have a tail I couldnt read him the way Id always read my dogs in the past. Hed let out a bark every now & then while we interacted but he wasnt barking at me so I offered him scoops of cat kibbles and checked out his collar but found it didnt have any¬†tags so I had my hubby hand me our old Saint Bernards FlexiLeash & call the town police but either seeing the leash or my hubby made the Mastiff¬†bark as-if he was upset so I hid the leash and my hubby went¬†inside behind the door. It must have been my hubby that upset him because as soon as he was done¬†eating the last of the cat kibbles¬†I sat on a lawn chair and¬†he sat ON my feet with his back to me and lifted his head up and looked at me upside down...and then he proceeded to lay down all sprawled out/still ON my feet but very relaxed so I hooked his collar to the leash and awaited the town police. When the¬†officer arrived the dog barked at him a lot but didnt make any attempt to¬†get off the deck to get him. He just hung around by me barking at the officer thru the deck railing.¬†He asked if I could walk the dog to his patrol car but¬†not knowing if the dog liked the leash or not I suggested instead that he back-up the patrol car right to the deck to make it a very short little walk... and when hed backed-up the car¬†he stayed in the front and I hung out with the Mastiff until he had calmed down/stopped barking since the officer was out of sight and then I asked him WANNA GO OUT? WANNA GO OUT¬†IN THE CAR?! and he took a look at¬†the leash and the car and TOTALLY GOT THE POINT and he did a funny sorta PRANCE like he was EXCITED & WANTED to go¬†for the road trip but a PRANCING GIANT BULL MASTIFF is almost indistinguishable from a pissed-off GIANT BULL MASTIFF so¬†initially for a split second I thought he was going to leap up and¬†eat my face off so I was RELIEVED when his PRANCING turned into a BEELINE straight for the patrol car with me in tow sorta like a water-skier LOL! He stopped at the back door of the patrol car as he apparently knew the drill VERY WELL; when I opened the¬†back door of the K-9 unit¬†he hesitated for a moment then hopped in and SQUEEZED his body to turn-around and lay down across the back seat and IMMEDIATELY settled-in for the ride! It was a beautiful thing!¬†We later learned the officer took him to the local humane shelter and the owners retrieved him so alls well that ends well.¬†¬†He was beautiful albeit hard to read and makes me miss my dog-owner-days!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6964403476765278, 0.3035596523234721))</td><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>1756498.0</td><td>Heres what I will say: thank you for producing a very well done short introductory film with two fine women who have devoted their lives to the betterment of this specific breed. There are likely to be thousands of ignorant and uninformed uneducated bias-ridden comments on any of your video threads particularly some of these rarer breeds that have been referred to as bastardized. These are coming from people who generally do not understand the real concept of what preservation breeding truly means and the devotion it takes to protect a breed and better it with each generation especially having come from a virtually extinct gene pool. People who rally around bashing anything on the Internet I find rely heavily on said resource to inform what they know about a breed (or various other topic). If you do not own train breed medically treat or fervently study any breed of dog you are not an expert on it. Relying on various social media platforms to properly and thoroughly educate individuals on all that was is and will be a Shar-Pei is an unfathomable notion. I celebrate this video and who stand behind it‚Äîthis information is correct but it is also only a 25 minute long feature that highlights the most significant information for the average person. I encourage everyone that feels so inclined to say they know this breed and make claims that are unfounded to take a step back and ask themselves really how educated and unbiased they are because most of the comments I read are riddled with opinions that are not founded on experience or proper study. Go to a library go to a dog history museum go to the breed clubs historians read books; go to shows and ask the people who are handling the dogs youre interested in. This video channel is a fabulous resource and I applaud the effort put into all the videos but its just a starting point for each breed. The Chinese Shar-Pei standard can be found on the breed club website cspca.com and it fully serves as the proper educational and historical resource the breed bashers should really consider investigating. Its too bad the Internet social media and backyard breeders have painted such a negative view of my breed in so manys eyes. This is not what the purpose of preservation breeding is supposed to be: its about keeping the health and temperament at the forefront of the breeders minds in protecting the dogs and keeping their history alive. Calling them useless I personally found completely harsh and offensive especially considering that I take mine to obedience class every week do therapy programs and am training for agility with my female. They are highly intelligent and purposeful breeding preserves their all purpose farm dog capabilities and you are foolish if you choose to believe that they are weak soft stupid or unsound as a generalization of the breed. Well socialized and hand reared Shar-Pei puppies are non such a thing. They may be fixated on their one person but a sound dog is never overly timid fearful or aggressive. Assertive powerful smart and excessively loyal... they can do it all if you invite them to it and I cannot overstate how significant the natural guarding and protection ability inherently withdraws from my dogs when they feel I am being threatened or challenged. To my friends who poured a lot into this video thank you. To all else who choose to explore the breed more I encourage you to do so... without relying on only one source of information. That is never a way to become an expert on anything; especially if you have no experience with it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.014225872433643982, 0.9857741275663561))</td><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>1854347.0</td><td>I love all dogs and my dog Rollo so much!

A family bought him as a 9month pup for a gift to their 5yearold with cancer. Unfortunately the little girl didnt live to meet him and for the mother it was too heartbreaking to keep him. So she was going to dump him in the nearest shelter.My family happened to be visiting the day she was going to dump him and we were able to take him in ourselves. In February he turned six and is a very happy healthy stubborn butt head haha.The second is a BorderCollie/Lab mix named Pepper. He was a stray that wandered in December during the worst freeze wed seen. He was soaking wet starving half frozen and very much afraid.We couldnt approach him at first he would get so scared hed trip over himself trying to run away.But he eventually warmed up to us and told us this by sitting in front of the door weeping poor baby! We let him inside to get warm and dry gave him some food as well. He was still pretty scared so I personally sat by him for the next five hours gently petting him. We identified his age as a little more than a year.Him and Jack get along fairly well and we realized we accidentally gave them a cheesy names. Pepper JackBoth are happy and healthy. They sleep in my room and Pepper paws at you until you pet him. The longer we had him the more we found signs of abuse. Which is likely why he was so terrified. Hes still pretty shy but also very loving!I love both my dogs very much!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.006121900445922136, 0.9938780995540778))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>663646.0</td><td>flash looks like my dog sassy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.038429917060085805, 0.9615700829399142))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>746663.0</td><td>Kona is my dogs name he is a cockapoo</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.10547435765913188, 0.8945256423408682))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>761115.0</td><td>i just got 2 kittens and seeing this hurts me and i am glad my cats wont ever have to go to something like taht</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.02771674094482379, 0.9722832590551763))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>816004.0</td><td>i was going to release my dog today but im not so sure anymore</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.10267261657861967, 0.8973273834213804))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>823880.0</td><td>I cryd thay sounded just like my dog he cryd and cryd and i askd my g ma for him and she seid yes and he stopd i was so happy we where so happy i cryd watching this its so sad that thair mom left themüò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.4456413216528874, 0.5543586783471126))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>914662.0</td><td>If you guys found a dog thats White and she has kind of curly fur and a pink nose that my dog name Emma I MISS HER SOOOOOO MUCH!!!!üò¢üò¢üò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üòîüòû</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.0571275461563604, 0.9428724538436395))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>934576.0</td><td>my puppy passed away today someone hit him with a car and messed up his spinal cord and he had to be put down ~ June 26 2017</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.17800906157804178, 0.8219909384219583))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>960433.0</td><td>This video made me cry because I lost my dog and to think he could be down there somewhere makes me so sad.

That said vibration for some reason every since I started the conditioning with her she just stops everything and lays down.  I didnt train that or anything that has just always been her natural reaction so I just left that and when she gets distracted and I need her attention vibrate.  Anyway I had a question with how to help my dog stay calm with other people.  When someone comes over she just gets super excited and does this cry whimper noise.  She will eventually calm down but I would rather a barking alert when someone comes to the house not an overly excited whimpering dog wanting attention.

I also have two cats.Tomorrow my husband and I are adding two parakeets to our menagerie.

I was 10 years old when he arrived to the family. My father summoned me and my big bro to the living room with a suprise hidden inside his jacket. Just when he mentioned the word surprise his tiny little head came out just like a baby kangaroo. He was so small 2 months and he was wearing a white sock as a jacket. He was trembling but very happy to receive our deepest love. We grew up together for 11 years vaccines trips to the beach trips to the mall -you name it. Everything. Until one day he disappeared from the house during a family meeting. Nobody noticed because the house was big and the dog was very independent. After a couple of hours a complete stranger knocked the door of our house. He said do you have a dog with these characteristics? and after agreement he asked me to follow him to the next street because he saw my dog. I was worried but the worse was yet to come. He was there lying on the dirt bleeding with flies and ants around his wounds. His wounds were not fresh. Another dog bit him. And so like a father I dived for his son grabbed him ran home and yelled thank you to that stranger. I madly drove Kemiur to the vet and he did his best diagnosis but the answer was heart-breaking: He is not going to make it. Im sorry. With tears on my eyes I agreed to the most painful acknowledgement a father can agree with. Put him to sleep. He lived 11 years with us and now I personally buried him.

It drives me insane when people say you dont know what youre talking about. You know exactly what youre talking about. You understand dog behaviour/learning to the key.

Youll always face adversity but thats normal thats part of it all its especially part of being successful; people will always wanna bring you down even if youre great.Omg that part where Chuck yells at his client LOOK AT HIM! HES LOOKING AT ME! HE HAS NO BUSINESS LOOKING AT ANYTHING! (Bla bla bla). WOW! What a crock of shit! Shitty trainers like that get dogs killed. This kind of training is¬†EXACTLY¬†what turned my own dog into a monster back in the¬†days when I didnt know any better and I somehow¬†thought this all made sense. I thought I had to correct the stare-down. I was even told I could correct my dog for having her hackles or tail up! I was TOLD that!¬†Instead I could have been click/rewarding my dog for looking at triggers. But nope I was too busy choking or yanking my dog on a prong collar;¬†she became extremely paranoid and pre-emptively aggressive any time a person or dog came in sight or she so much as *thought* another person or dog was present - it could be a garbage bag/can on the side of the road a tree/bush a shadow a sound of any sort that resembled footsteps or a collar/tags jingling. So many different things became potential triggers and my dog was basically psychotic from this sort of training/treatment.Shes still an anxious dog and I dont think that will change¬†- I dont think my dog will ever be what she could have been - but at least now she can predict what is going to happen in most common situations. An unfamiliar dog appears - treats are delivered or we quickly go through some fun Rally-O¬†moves or tricks¬†- Front get ready heel sit get in or Spin wave beg¬†take a bow¬†- treat treat treat. Fun stuff happens. And she will never be on a choke or prong again - her reaction to being on a harness or gentle leader is so much different. Even on a flat collar she still gets uncomfortable because she feels that conditioned emotional response to pressure on her throat.Anyways Im so glad I found better ways. Glad you do what you do. Keep on! Sorry for my random long comment. Every now and then I like to explain my background with my dog a bit another thing that drives me crazy is when people dont think I know what theyre talking about when it comes to corrections and the training tools they use. No I get it... I just know better now.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.10376370175499511, 0.8962362982450048))</td><td>Pawfessor</td><td>1563715.0</td><td>When you said that throwing food in front of a dog and having them leave it is advanced I got really proud of my dog and the work Ive put in to training him.

I have been through something similar. I was losing fish went from 15 to 4 in a very short amount of time and I was trying everything to save them. It turned out to be my tap water. I got it tested and it contained a chemical from algae that while not harmful to humans it is deadly to fish. I contacted my towns local water district but got no where. I almost gave up on the hobby. I just felt totally defeated. I seriously considered just quitting. I didnt though. Ultimately I had to just get a whole home water filter system that I could hook my Python hose up to. It has 3 filters with the last one being a carbon and resin block to pull out the toxin. It worked and I was not only able to save my last 4 fish but eventually I got new fish and now have happy healthy fish again. Just know you are not alone we all have things happen no matter how careful we are. I had been in the hobby 20 years before my catastrophe happened but it happened and watching your videos along with others helped me realize that sometimes things just happen in the hobby and you cant let it beat you.

Growing up I lived in an area with no stray cats at all and I never saw another cat in the neighborhood.  We did live on a kind of busy road but not too busy and my cat happily went inside and out for his whole life.  Generally he just wanted to go outside and sit in the sun.  When he was younger hed roam more and fight but he lived to be almost 25 so it didnt harm him.Where I live now Id NEVER let my cats outside!  There are stray cats everywhere which is a huge vector for disease there are tons of fleas and ticks which is also a vector for disease.  IMO the rule of thumb has to be it depends on the cat and it depends on where you live.  Some cats are street smart and some arent and imo a road with no traffic is probably more dangerous than a road with a lot of traffic where cats deal with cars all the time.  But its always safer to keep them inside.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.484086940098978, 0.5159130599010219))</td><td>Solid Gold Aquatics</td><td>2173360.0</td><td>I live in a rural area on a 5 acre property and my cats have always been free to do as they like indoors and outdoors.

A few months before he underwent two surgeries to remove a strange lump/cyst in his neck and I believe that might have cause a strain on his heart. He was seven years old and has been in perfect health throughout his whole life. Sometimes theres nothing you can do and we as humans shouldnt be egoistic and keep our animals alive if they suffer.

There the vet said she was only feeling bad because of the climate and that she needed to be in a fresh place and so we did that... She didnt get better by night and I think I saw it coming cause I had a really long talk with her about our future. Around 4:00 am Sunday she died and that really tore me up. We were a full week not knowing what happened to her and by that time we were putting three puppies (of another couple of dogs) for adoption and one of them fell very sick when playing with a toy that used to be of Camila. We took them to another vet where we finally found out what had happened... It was Canine Parvovirus... We managed to save the three puppies and found them a home.

Im a beginner so i got a beta fish instead but i did everything i could to make sure its in a healthy and stable habitat and i made sure to inform my mother about every last detail about his PROPER care. Its been about 6 months and he is still alive and well! Thanks to you!

I freaked out confused how the heck the turtle came from and I still to this day dont know where it came from. I showed my parents and so we took it out and I checked what gender it was and it was a female and was a red eared slider (I live in Texas) I kept her a while my parents bought me a big aquarium with all the good things and i took good care of her. Yet she didnt grow I then realize the aquarium we got doesnt have a good heating lamp. I realized I could afford the actual good lamp to help her grow. Luckily my aunt and uncle are good animal keepers and said they would gladly take her. A couple weeks ago I gave her away to them and they showed me pictures and I almost teared up seeing her swimming and living a good life . If your wondering why I didnt put her back in the wild she was so small. Maybe even smaller then these turtles. Idk when she hatched but I couldnt just let a small baby turtle back in the wild and all the ponds near me have snakes and other turtles but I didnt want her to die because she was a sweet turtle. Sorry for such a long story about my turtle. Also I love u Taylor! <3</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5600011793408298, 0.43999882065917006))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>1856554.0</td><td>I had 2 crabs they died ah its fine I have a dog Im happy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16066361246317004, 0.83933638753683))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>1856554.0</td><td>oh and they died because I was depresped and just wanted to give up on pets because iv had 6 crab but they all died at lest I have a dog and a lot of cats who want one come pick them up I have kittens to 4 lettries</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.004364000853296504, 0.9956359991467035))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>1897220.0</td><td>The black and white kitty looks exactly like my cat named Milo</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.553951267078467, 0.446048732921533))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>1948917.0</td><td>Theres a chain pet store where I live that takes rodent and reptile rescues (animals that would otherwise be abandoned or not cared for well) or doesnt have any pets for sale at all.

She had an eye infection and was a liter of a ferral(?) cat and they basically ate the food we put outside for them because we already had 2 cats of our own at the time. And one stood out. She kept running into walls and lost balance a lot. My sister was able to catch her and my mom already had dealt with a cat eye infection before so we were able to use anything from our last infection on the kitten. And basically that night I got instantly attached to her. She would come to me climb up on my shoulder and she would CONSTANTLY and STILL does today at 1 licks my face and my ear. We fed her kitten food and she slept in my room in a little dog crate we had temporary for a rabbit. She was so quick at using the restroom and she slept through the entire night. We instantly became inseparable. I would come home from school to a screaming kitten and wanting to play when I run through the door and excited to play with her.  She not only became attached to me but to my dog. She now grooms him sleeps next to him sleeps on his her and always follows him around. We eventually caught her two other sisters one we gave to our neighbor/my moms best friend and the other one we kept. We were gonna give her away because she would always hide under the couch and was just so cereal. It took us 3 months for her to finally come around and now her and my mom love each other. They are such a blessing in my life and seeing Nemo grow up reminds me so much of them when they were kittens. Also Taylor  you dont need to be sorry for not uploading its fine! We love you!

tends to get caught on low lying branches and thicker brush that I walk through also I tend to go scouting in other areas besides my woods I dont hunt but my father does so I usually go into woods that could run for miles with him and when your walking for hours on end as you may know can be hard with nothing more then a small bag on your side. ¬†Heres the thing my bag has been out in the rain while I was at a lake near my house before so its seen much better days especially now that its strap is wearing out. ¬†Plus I fish and am a starting photographer so when I wouldnt be using the bag in the woods it will probably be holding lures weights a smaller net and some pliers of course. ¬†And its hard to take an entire bucket on the back of an ATV down to the lake when I want to fish somewhere other then my pond. ¬†Another issue is when I want to take one of our labs Tera with me then I need even more supplies such as extra water bottles dog food and some small bowls plus depending where we are going a leash and harness so I believe this bag would just make everything easier plus I havent read the Coyote book yet and have been wanting to considering how much I have loved animals and still do since I was just a little girl and even now as Im entering high school iv still never met an animal I have hated despite being lunged at by a a copperhead snake while I was watching my dog swim in the pond. ¬†Thank you so much for reading this and good luck to everyone!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818,

brought in by Coyote climbing the Sting Pain Index I stayed for the great personalities on the channel. Honestly I havent felt this connected to really good nature content since I was a kid growing up watching Steve Irwin and the Kratt brothers. The quality of the channel is incredible the shots are great the episodes are funny and informative. I came out of a really bad spot in my life last year which included being homeless in a tent in a foot of snow and when I look at myself now with my own apartment my cat a job and things I own and a great support network watching shows that make me feel good and help me learn more about the beauty of the world its a really good feeling. A couple months ago I even got a tattoo thats now a forest forearm sleeve thats going to go up into mountains and a night sky that just really celebrates the beauty of the West Coast.And what Id use the adventure pack for? Im not gonna lie to you - itll probably mostly be on display. Ive been collecting books of people I admire and supporting their work and the Brave Adventures book would totally look great in my meager but growing collection. But for the most part itll travel with me in the summer while I show my boyfriend and friend the beauty of my corner of Canadas Southwest coast. Gonna go to the aquarium and Science World and maybe the planetarium cruise Stanley Park head out on the ferry. Fun stuff where I could absolutely use the pack to carry water and snacks and other such things.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>1712429.0</td><td>all I did was play wrestle with my dog for the 5 years Ive owned her and she does go for the forearm. she knew what to do instantly.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>1777036.0</td><td>I have a dog named turtle.

My dog was 13 y.o. when she died of cancer. I was completely devastated and cried a lot. She never came to me in my dreams even though i asked her.  She died in November and in March my cat who was only 14 years old got sick and passed away literally in two days. It was really weird because everything went terribly wrong when he got sick and it felt like he was destine to die. I was totally heartbroken. I missed him so much that for whatever reason i thought that if i would go to a shelter and adopt a cat that looks like him i would get my cat back. That was exactly what i did. I went to a few shelters and one of them had one large cat room where you could walk in and pet the cats they were offering for adoption. I went inside and petted a cat who looked very similar to the cat i had.  This cat looked at me and climbed on my shoulders. I put her back on a bench but she climbed on my shoulders again and  she was rubbing herself against my neck. People who worked at that shelter were literally stunned because she did not do that to anyone. I adopted her and brought her home. At first i was disappointed because in my disturbed mind at that time i thought that she would have the same personality as my deceased cat but her personality was completely different. As i got to know her better it totally hit me that she acts absolutely like my dog that passed away in November.  Everyone who knew that dog also noticed that.  I believe that this cat is actually my reincarnated dog. Her soul went to the body of this cat and she came back to me. By the way since i brought her home she never jumped on my shoulders like she did it in the shelter.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Brent Atwater</td><td>770628.0</td><td>Thank you so much for your videos.

Ive always been non believer. I always felt guilty because Im convinced I didnt do enough for him and I scolded him sometimes for things that werent his fault. Soon after his death he started to visit me in my dreams. The first dream I had was horrible he looked fine and healthy but when I tried to pet him he turned skin and bones almost a skeleton. The following visits were better he stil looked old and dirty but he was always eating and he didnt look like he was suffering and I felt like he never died and he just returned from where I never realized in my dreams. Every time he visited me I always woke up crying and I went on crying for the whole following day I dont even know why.Its been a lot since the last time he visited me the last night I thought just that I havent seen my cat since a whole year now I would love if he could visit me again... and that night he visited me again stil looking sick but he was eating a lot and looking happy overall and it was like he never died. I knew in my dream that he was 26 years old and I kept saying we need to call the vet and get the surgery done this time or his condition will get worse... The vet will be very surprised on his improvements though he put on a lot of weight and he looks like a different cat from the last time the vet came... why did the vet came last time? He just looked at him and did nothing how weird (in reality the last time the vet came it was to put him down)... and that morning I wake up and started crying again and now I realized that my cat stopped visiting me because he didnt want to make me cry every time he showed up. Do you think its that the reason he didnt came more often?

And I dont mean adequately giving them the basics: food water etc. I mean when you get to the point that your attention can not be divided any further.  Its also a matter of whats important to you.  Somebody who spends their time at work out with friends shopping etc. would say holy shit you have too many pets how do you do it? I can do it because I WANT to give my extra time to them. Between classes? I dont go to the mall I take my dogs to a park.  Its all about whats important to you.  I want to come home and pet my cats.  Curl up in bed with a pile of fluff.  People say how can you afford it? Again. Its all about where you choose to put your money.  I would much rather spend my extra money on good dog food cat toys things for my snakes terrarium than on expensive clothes or shoes or makeup.  Id rather save money for vet appointments than vacations.  Its just. I donno. Its that animal loving gene you were talking about. Some people get it or they dont.  As for do you have too many pets?  You have too many when you start forgetting their names and oh yeah! I have a bearded dragon over here. If you have the time and WANT to greet and spend time with each of your pets at the shop.

Without thinking I flung open my door and greeted him with a big HEY FELLA what cha doing cmere!! and he barked just ONE HUGE BARK but didnt gesture towards me (like he was greeting me in response). He stood looking at me but also looking toward our back deck where 2 outdoor cats were watching his every move. He was more intrigued by them than me and half-trotted around back to investigate - but definitely not looking to kill them so I turned back inside and met him out the back porch door. By then the¬†cats disappeared so I proffered him a huge pot of beef stew Id intended to give the cats and he happily gobbled it up but since he was JET black and didnt have a tail I couldnt read him the way Id always read my dogs in the past. Hed let out a bark every now & then while we interacted but he wasnt barking at me so I offered him scoops of cat kibbles and checked out his collar but found it didnt have any¬†tags so I had my hubby hand me our old Saint Bernards FlexiLeash & call the town police but either seeing the leash or my hubby made the Mastiff¬†bark as-if he was upset so I hid the leash and my hubby went¬†inside behind the door. It must have been my hubby that upset him because as soon as he was done¬†eating the last of the cat kibbles¬†I sat on a lawn chair and¬†he sat ON my feet with his back to me and lifted his head up and looked at me upside down...and then he proceeded to lay down all sprawled out/still ON my feet but very relaxed so I hooked his collar to the leash and awaited the town police. When the¬†officer arrived the dog barked at him a lot but didnt make any attempt to¬†get off the deck to get him. He just hung around by me barking at the officer thru the deck railing.¬†He asked if I could walk the dog to his patrol car but¬†not knowing if the dog liked the leash or not I suggested instead that he back-up the patrol car right to the deck to make it a very short little walk... and when hed backed-up the car¬†he stayed in the front and I hung out with the Mastiff until he had calmed down/stopped barking since the officer was out of sight and then I asked him WANNA GO OUT? WANNA GO OUT¬†IN THE CAR?! and he took a look at¬†the leash and the car and TOTALLY GOT THE POINT and he did a funny sorta PRANCE like he was EXCITED & WANTED to go¬†for the road trip but a PRANCING GIANT BULL MASTIFF is almost indistinguishable from a pissed-off GIANT BULL MASTIFF so¬†initially for a split second I thought he was going to leap up and¬†eat my face off so I was RELIEVED when his PRANCING turned into a BEELINE straight for the patrol car with me in tow sorta like a water-skier LOL! He stopped at the back door of the patrol car as he apparently knew the drill VERY WELL; when I opened the¬†back door of the K-9 unit¬†he hesitated for a moment then hopped in and SQUEEZED his body to turn-around and lay down across the back seat and IMMEDIATELY settled-in for the ride! It was a beautiful thing!¬†We later learned the officer took him to the local humane shelter and the owners retrieved him so alls well that ends well.¬†¬†He was beautiful albeit hard to read and makes me miss my dog-owner-days!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>1756498.0</td><td>Heres what I will say: thank you for producing a very well done short introductory film with two fine women who have devoted their lives to the betterment of this specific breed. There are likely to be thousands of ignorant and uninformed uneducated bias-ridden comments on any of your video threads particularly some of these rarer breeds that have been referred to as bastardized. These are coming from people who generally do not understand the real concept of what preservation breeding truly means and the devotion it takes to protect a breed and better it with each generation especially having come from a virtually extinct gene pool. People who rally around bashing anything on the Internet I find rely heavily on said resource to inform what they know about a breed (or various other topic). If you do not own train breed medically treat or fervently study any breed of dog you are not an expert on it. Relying on various social media platforms to properly and thoroughly educate individuals on all that was is and will be a Shar-Pei is an unfathomable notion. I celebrate this video and who stand behind it‚Äîthis information is correct but it is also only a 25 minute long feature that highlights the most significant information for the average person. I encourage everyone that feels so inclined to say they know this breed and make claims that are unfounded to take a step back and ask themselves really how educated and unbiased they are because most of the comments I read are riddled with opinions that are not founded on experience or proper study. Go to a library go to a dog history museum go to the breed clubs historians read books; go to shows and ask the people who are handling the dogs youre interested in. This video channel is a fabulous resource and I applaud the effort put into all the videos but its just a starting point for each breed. The Chinese Shar-Pei standard can be found on the breed club website cspca.com and it fully serves as the proper educational and historical resource the breed bashers should really consider investigating. Its too bad the Internet social media and backyard breeders have painted such a negative view of my breed in so manys eyes. This is not what the purpose of preservation breeding is supposed to be: its about keeping the health and temperament at the forefront of the breeders minds in protecting the dogs and keeping their history alive. Calling them useless I personally found completely harsh and offensive especially considering that I take mine to obedience class every week do therapy programs and am training for agility with my female. They are highly intelligent and purposeful breeding preserves their all purpose farm dog capabilities and you are foolish if you choose to believe that they are weak soft stupid or unsound as a generalization of the breed. Well socialized and hand reared Shar-Pei puppies are non such a thing. They may be fixated on their one person but a sound dog is never overly timid fearful or aggressive. Assertive powerful smart and excessively loyal... they can do it all if you invite them to it and I cannot overstate how significant the natural guarding and protection ability inherently withdraws from my dogs when they feel I am being threatened or challenged. To my friends who poured a lot into this video thank you. To all else who choose to explore the breed more I encourage you to do so... without relying on only one source of information. That is never a way to become an expert on anything; especially if you have no experience with it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.866607528968232, 0.13339247103176805))</td><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>1854347.0</td><td>I love all dogs and my dog Rollo so much!

He was soaking wet starving half frozen and very much afraid.We couldnt approach him at first he would get so scared hed trip over himself trying to run away.But he eventually warmed up to us and told us this by sitting in front of the door weeping poor baby! We let him inside to get warm and dry gave him some food as well. He was still pretty scared so I personally sat by him for the next five hours gently petting him. We identified his age as a little more than a year.Him and Jack get along fairly well and we realized we accidentally gave them a cheesy names. Pepper JackBoth are happy and healthy. They sleep in my room and Pepper paws at you until you pet him. The longer we had him the more we found signs of abuse. Which is likely why he was so terrified. Hes still pretty shy but also very loving!I love both my dogs very much!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>663646.0</td><td>flash looks like my dog sassy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>746663.0</td><td>Kona is my dogs name he is a cockapoo</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>761115.0</td><td>i just got 2 kittens and seeing this hurts me and i am glad my cats wont ever have to go to something like taht</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>816004.0</td><td>i was going to release my dog today but im not so sure anymore</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.866607528968232, 0.13339247103176805))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>823880.0</td><td>I cryd thay sounded just like my dog he cryd and cryd and i askd my g ma for him and she seid yes and he stopd i was so happy we where so happy i cryd watching this its so sad that thair mom left themüò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>914662.0</td><td>If you guys found a dog thats White and she has kind of curly fur and a pink nose that my dog name Emma I MISS HER SOOOOOO MUCH!!!!üò¢üò¢üò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üòîüòû</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>934576.0</td><td>my puppy passed away today someone hit him with a car and messed up his spinal cord and he had to be put down ~ June 26 2017</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>960433.0</td><td>This video made me cry because I lost my dog and to think he could be down there somewhere makes me so sad.

Ive also got a 3 stray cats in a alley way to trust me and rub all over me and stuff like that. I recently took care of a black half tailed kitten that was starving because the owners werent feeding her.......I know their neice and she said that the cat is just there to hang around and get pregnant. So I started feeding her and I named her Jamaica .....she was my best cat friend she would follow me everywhere and hang out with me.....then she got pregnant and THEN the owners started caring for her.....I miss her. Also people with outdoor cats.....the cats always follow me or come up to me and only me.......I must be a Disney princessüòÇ</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Jackson Galaxy</td><td>2402149.0</td><td>Come to Brazil please !!

That said vibration for some reason every since I started the conditioning with her she just stops everything and lays down.  I didnt train that or anything that has just always been her natural reaction so I just left that and when she gets distracted and I need her attention vibrate.  Anyway I had a question with how to help my dog stay calm with other people.  When someone comes over she just gets super excited and does this cry whimper noise.  She will eventually calm down but I would rather a barking alert when someone comes to the house not an overly excited whimpering dog wanting attention.

I was 10 years old when he arrived to the family. My father summoned me and my big bro to the living room with a suprise hidden inside his jacket. Just when he mentioned the word surprise his tiny little head came out just like a baby kangaroo. He was so small 2 months and he was wearing a white sock as a jacket. He was trembling but very happy to receive our deepest love. We grew up together for 11 years vaccines trips to the beach trips to the mall -you name it. Everything. Until one day he disappeared from the house during a family meeting. Nobody noticed because the house was big and the dog was very independent. After a couple of hours a complete stranger knocked the door of our house. He said do you have a dog with these characteristics? and after agreement he asked me to follow him to the next street because he saw my dog. I was worried but the worse was yet to come. He was there lying on the dirt bleeding with flies and ants around his wounds. His wounds were not fresh. Another dog bit him. And so like a father I dived for his son grabbed him ran home and yelled thank you to that stranger. I madly drove Kemiur to the vet and he did his best diagnosis but the answer was heart-breaking: He is not going to make it. Im sorry. With tears on my eyes I agreed to the most painful acknowledgement a father can agree with. Put him to sleep. He lived 11 years with us and now I personally buried him.

It drives me insane when people say you dont know what youre talking about. You know exactly what youre talking about. You understand dog behaviour/learning to the key.

Youll always face adversity but thats normal thats part of it all its especially part of being successful; people will always wanna bring you down even if youre great.Omg that part where Chuck yells at his client LOOK AT HIM! HES LOOKING AT ME! HE HAS NO BUSINESS LOOKING AT ANYTHING! (Bla bla bla). WOW! What a crock of shit! Shitty trainers like that get dogs killed. This kind of training is¬†EXACTLY¬†what turned my own dog into a monster back in the¬†days when I didnt know any better and I somehow¬†thought this all made sense. I thought I had to correct the stare-down. I was even told I could correct my dog for having her hackles or tail up! I was TOLD that!¬†Instead I could have been click/rewarding my dog for looking at triggers. But nope I was too busy choking or yanking my dog on a prong collar;¬†she became extremely paranoid and pre-emptively aggressive any time a person or dog came in sight or she so much as *thought* another person or dog was present - it could be a garbage bag/can on the side of the road a tree/bush a shadow a sound of any sort that resembled footsteps or a collar/tags jingling. So many different things became potential triggers and my dog was basically psychotic from this sort of training/treatment.Shes still an anxious dog and I dont think that will change¬†- I dont think my dog will ever be what she could have been - but at least now she can predict what is going to happen in most common situations. An unfamiliar dog appears - treats are delivered or we quickly go through some fun Rally-O¬†moves or tricks¬†- Front get ready heel sit get in or Spin wave beg¬†take a bow¬†- treat treat treat. Fun stuff happens. And she will never be on a choke or prong again - her reaction to being on a harness or gentle leader is so much different. Even on a flat collar she still gets uncomfortable because she feels that conditioned emotional response to pressure on her throat.Anyways Im so glad I found better ways. Glad you do what you do. Keep on! Sorry for my random long comment. Every now and then I like to explain my background with my dog a bit another thing that drives me crazy is when people dont think I know what theyre talking about when it comes to corrections and the training tools they use. No I get it...

I almost gave up on the hobby. I just felt totally defeated. I seriously considered just quitting. I didnt though. Ultimately I had to just get a whole home water filter system that I could hook my Python hose up to. It has 3 filters with the last one being a carbon and resin block to pull out the toxin. It worked and I was not only able to save my last 4 fish but eventually I got new fish and now have happy healthy fish again.

Growing up I lived in an area with no stray cats at all and I never saw another cat in the neighborhood.  We did live on a kind of busy road but not too busy and my cat happily went inside and out for his whole life.  Generally he just wanted to go outside and sit in the sun.  When he was younger hed roam more and fight but he lived to be almost 25 so it didnt harm him.Where I live now Id NEVER let my cats outside!  There are stray cats everywhere which is a huge vector for disease there are tons of fleas and ticks which is also a vector for disease.  IMO the rule of thumb has to be it depends on the cat and it depends on where you live.  Some cats are street smart and some arent and imo a road with no traffic is probably more dangerous than a road with a lot of traffic where cats deal with cars all the time.  But its always safer to keep them inside.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.866607528968232, 0.13339247103176805))</td><td>Solid Gold Aquatics</td><td>2173360.0</td><td>I live in a rural area on a 5 acre property and my cats have always been free to do as they like indoors and outdoors.

A few months before he underwent two surgeries to remove a strange lump/cyst in his neck and I believe that might have cause a strain on his heart. He was seven years old and has been in perfect health throughout his whole life. Sometimes theres nothing you can do and we as humans shouldnt be egoistic and keep our animals alive if they suffer. Dont listen to the haters! P.S. I watch your channel since I could never keep pets like yours for myself.

There the vet said she was only feeling bad because of the climate and that she needed to be in a fresh place and so we did that... She didnt get better by night and I think I saw it coming cause I had a really long talk with her about our future. Around 4:00 am Sunday she died and that really tore me up. We were a full week not knowing what happened to her and by that time we were putting three puppies (of another couple of dogs) for adoption and one of them fell very sick when playing with a toy that used to be of Camila. We took them to another vet where we finally found out what had happened... It was Canine Parvovirus... We managed to save the three puppies and found them a home.

I freaked out confused how the heck the turtle came from and I still to this day dont know where it came from. I showed my parents and so we took it out and I checked what gender it was and it was a female and was a red eared slider (I live in Texas) I kept her a while my parents bought me a big aquarium with all the good things and i took good care of her. Yet she didnt grow I then realize the aquarium we got doesnt have a good heating lamp. I realized I could afford the actual good lamp to help her grow. Luckily my aunt and uncle are good animal keepers and said they would gladly take her. A couple weeks ago I gave her away to them and they showed me pictures and I almost teared up seeing her swimming and living a good life . If your wondering why I didnt put her back in the wild she was so small. Maybe even smaller then these turtles. Idk when she hatched but I couldnt just let a small baby turtle back in the wild and all the ponds near me have snakes and other turtles but I didnt want her to die because she was a sweet turtle.

She had an eye infection and was a liter of a ferral(?) cat and they basically ate the food we put outside for them because we already had 2 cats of our own at the time. And one stood out. She kept running into walls and lost balance a lot. My sister was able to catch her and my mom already had dealt with a cat eye infection before so we were able to use anything from our last infection on the kitten. And basically that night I got instantly attached to her. She would come to me climb up on my shoulder and she would CONSTANTLY and STILL does today at 1 licks my face and my ear. We fed her kitten food and she slept in my room in a little dog crate we had temporary for a rabbit. She was so quick at using the restroom and she slept through the entire night. We instantly became inseparable. I would come home from school to a screaming kitten and wanting to play when I run through the door and excited to play with her.  She not only became attached to me but to my dog. She now grooms him sleeps next to him sleeps on his her and always follows him around. We eventually caught her two other sisters one we gave to our neighbor/my moms best friend and the other one we kept. We were gonna give her away because she would always hide under the couch and was just so cereal. It took us 3 months for her to finally come around and now her and my mom love each other. They are such a blessing in my life and seeing Nemo grow up reminds me so much of them when they were kittens. Also Taylor  you dont need to be sorry for not uploading its fine! We love you! And I hope you get the rest you need to get a full and healthy recovery from ear infections and colds and fevers. üòä</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.16648189209164818, 0.8335181079083518))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>2471304.0</td><td>please name the boy buddlynn or buddy for short cause thats what my cat looked like but...

tends to get caught on low lying branches and thicker brush that I walk through also I tend to go scouting in other areas besides my woods I dont hunt but my father does so I usually go into woods that could run for miles with him and when your walking for hours on end as you may know can be hard with nothing more then a small bag on your side. ¬†Heres the thing my bag has been out in the rain while I was at a lake near my house before so its seen much better days especially now that its strap is wearing out. ¬†Plus I fish and am a starting photographer so when I wouldnt be using the bag in the woods it will probably be holding lures weights a smaller net and some pliers of course. ¬†And its hard to take an entire bucket on the back of an ATV down to the lake when I want to fish somewhere other then my pond. ¬†Another issue is when I want to take one of our labs Tera with me then I need even more supplies such as extra water bottles dog food and some small bowls plus depending where we are going a leash and harness so I believe this bag would just make everything easier plus I havent read the Coyote book yet and have been wanting to considering how much I have loved animals and still do since I was just a little girl and even now as Im entering high school iv still never met an animal I have hated despite being lunged at by a a copperhead snake while I was watching my dog swim in the pond. ¬†Thank you so much for reading this and good luck to everyone!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338,

brought in by Coyote climbing the Sting Pain Index I stayed for the great personalities on the channel. Honestly I havent felt this connected to really good nature content since I was a kid growing up watching Steve Irwin and the Kratt brothers. The quality of the channel is incredible the shots are great the episodes are funny and informative. I came out of a really bad spot in my life last year which included being homeless in a tent in a foot of snow and when I look at myself now with my own apartment my cat a job and things I own and a great support network watching shows that make me feel good and help me learn more about the beauty of the world its a really good feeling. A couple months ago I even got a tattoo thats now a forest forearm sleeve thats going to go up into mountains and a night sky that just really celebrates the beauty of the West Coast.And what Id use the adventure pack for? Im not gonna lie to you - itll probably mostly be on display. Ive been collecting books of people I admire and supporting their work and the Brave Adventures book would totally look great in my meager but growing collection. But for the most part itll travel with me in the summer while I show my boyfriend and friend the beauty of my corner of Canadas Southwest coast. Gonna go to the aquarium and Science World and maybe the planetarium cruise Stanley Park head out on the ferry. Fun stuff where I could absolutely use the pack to carry water and snacks and other such things.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>1712429.0</td><td>all I did was play wrestle with my dog for the 5 years Ive owned her and she does go for the forearm. she knew what to do instantly.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>1777036.0</td><td>I have a dog named turtle.

My dog was 13 y.o. when she died of cancer. I was completely devastated and cried a lot. She never came to me in my dreams even though i asked her.  She died in November and in March my cat who was only 14 years old got sick and passed away literally in two days. It was really weird because everything went terribly wrong when he got sick and it felt like he was destine to die. I was totally heartbroken. I missed him so much that for whatever reason i thought that if i would go to a shelter and adopt a cat that looks like him i would get my cat back. That was exactly what i did. I went to a few shelters and one of them had one large cat room where you could walk in and pet the cats they were offering for adoption. I went inside and petted a cat who looked very similar to the cat i had.  This cat looked at me and climbed on my shoulders. I put her back on a bench but she climbed on my shoulders again and  she was rubbing herself against my neck. People who worked at that shelter were literally stunned because she did not do that to anyone. I adopted her and brought her home. At first i was disappointed because in my disturbed mind at that time i thought that she would have the same personality as my deceased cat but her personality was completely different. As i got to know her better it totally hit me that she acts absolutely like my dog that passed away in November.  Everyone who knew that dog also noticed that.  I believe that this cat is actually my reincarnated dog. Her soul went to the body of this cat and she came back to me. By the way since i brought her home she never jumped on my shoulders like she did it in the shelter.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Brent Atwater</td><td>770628.0</td><td>Thank you so much for your videos.

Ive always been non believer. I always felt guilty because Im convinced I didnt do enough for him and I scolded him sometimes for things that werent his fault. Soon after his death he started to visit me in my dreams. The first dream I had was horrible he looked fine and healthy but when I tried to pet him he turned skin and bones almost a skeleton. The following visits were better he stil looked old and dirty but he was always eating and he didnt look like he was suffering and I felt like he never died and he just returned from where I never realized in my dreams. Every time he visited me I always woke up crying and I went on crying for the whole following day I dont even know why.Its been a lot since the last time he visited me the last night I thought just that I havent seen my cat since a whole year now I would love if he could visit me again... and that night he visited me again stil looking sick but he was eating a lot and looking happy overall and it was like he never died. I knew in my dream that he was 26 years old and I kept saying we need to call the vet and get the surgery done this time or his condition will get worse... The vet will be very surprised on his improvements though he put on a lot of weight and he looks like a different cat from the last time the vet came... why did the vet came last time? He just looked at him and did nothing how weird (in reality the last time the vet came it was to put him down)... and that morning I wake up and started crying again and now I realized that my cat stopped visiting me because he didnt want to make me cry every time he showed up. Do you think its that the reason he didnt came more often?

And I dont mean adequately giving them the basics: food water etc. I mean when you get to the point that your attention can not be divided any further.  Its also a matter of whats important to you.  Somebody who spends their time at work out with friends shopping etc. would say holy shit you have too many pets how do you do it? I can do it because I WANT to give my extra time to them. Between classes? I dont go to the mall I take my dogs to a park.  Its all about whats important to you.  I want to come home and pet my cats.  Curl up in bed with a pile of fluff.  People say how can you afford it? Again. Its all about where you choose to put your money.  I would much rather spend my extra money on good dog food cat toys things for my snakes terrarium than on expensive clothes or shoes or makeup.  Id rather save money for vet appointments than vacations.  Its just. I donno. Its that animal loving gene you were talking about. Some people get it or they dont.  As for do you have too many pets?  You have too many when you start forgetting their names and oh yeah! I have a bearded dragon over here. If you have the time and WANT to greet and spend time with each of your pets at the shop. Then youre more than entitled to have them Brian.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>1959920.0</td><td>my dog just past awey to.i now how it fiells .bless your dog i hope he makes it throow.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.1648471615720524, 0.8351528384279476))</td><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>1976525.0</td><td>hope  the dog feel better brian my dog went throw that do he live</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.6696428571428571, 0.33035714285714285))</td><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>1999657.0</td><td>Im so sorry my puppys are my everything Im so sorry Ill pray for her aswell</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>2054516.0</td><td>I can relate to you I have 9 dogs 7 of my dogs died so i have two dogs leftüê∂üê∂üê∂üê∂üê∂üê∂üê∂üê∂üê∂üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>2097942.0</td><td>I hope arty gets better so so sorry but I know what your feeling because my dog got cancer she been in the family for 9 years I am 9 so she was there at the same time I was born but she is still alive</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5055350553505535, 0.4944649446494465))</td><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>2114446.0</td><td>I have a dog too.

The Maltese also sometimes pees around the house but not as often as the Yorkie does. Also the males tend to get into these brawls with one another that can get quite vicious so we try our best to keep the male dogs separated. Also the Yorkie has somewhat of a runaway problem so we are pretty much on our toes almost all the time about him. Now whether or not some of that is jealousy territorial etc etc... I don‚Äòt know. I am looking to really help my dogs. It would be nice to have them all together and behaving particularly well.

Without thinking I flung open my door and greeted him with a big HEY FELLA what cha doing cmere!! and he barked just ONE HUGE BARK but didnt gesture towards me (like he was greeting me in response). He stood looking at me but also looking toward our back deck where 2 outdoor cats were watching his every move. He was more intrigued by them than me and half-trotted around back to investigate - but definitely not looking to kill them so I turned back inside and met him out the back porch door. By then the¬†cats disappeared so I proffered him a huge pot of beef stew Id intended to give the cats and he happily gobbled it up but since he was JET black and didnt have a tail I couldnt read him the way Id always read my dogs in the past. Hed let out a bark every now & then while we interacted but he wasnt barking at me so I offered him scoops of cat kibbles and checked out his collar but found it didnt have any¬†tags so I had my hubby hand me our old Saint Bernards FlexiLeash & call the town police but either seeing the leash or my hubby made the Mastiff¬†bark as-if he was upset so I hid the leash and my hubby went¬†inside behind the door. It must have been my hubby that upset him because as soon as he was done¬†eating the last of the cat kibbles¬†I sat on a lawn chair and¬†he sat ON my feet with his back to me and lifted his head up and looked at me upside down...and then he proceeded to lay down all sprawled out/still ON my feet but very relaxed so I hooked his collar to the leash and awaited the town police. When the¬†officer arrived the dog barked at him a lot but didnt make any attempt to¬†get off the deck to get him. He just hung around by me barking at the officer thru the deck railing.¬†He asked if I could walk the dog to his patrol car but¬†not knowing if the dog liked the leash or not I suggested instead that he back-up the patrol car right to the deck to make it a very short little walk... and when hed backed-up the car¬†he stayed in the front and I hung out with the Mastiff until he had calmed down/stopped barking since the officer was out of sight and then I asked him WANNA GO OUT? WANNA GO OUT¬†IN THE CAR?! and he took a look at¬†the leash and the car and TOTALLY GOT THE POINT and he did a funny sorta PRANCE like he was EXCITED & WANTED to go¬†for the road trip but a PRANCING GIANT BULL MASTIFF is almost indistinguishable from a pissed-off GIANT BULL MASTIFF so¬†initially for a split second I thought he was going to leap up and¬†eat my face off so I was RELIEVED when his PRANCING turned into a BEELINE straight for the patrol car with me in tow sorta like a water-skier LOL! He stopped at the back door of the patrol car as he apparently knew the drill VERY WELL; when I opened the¬†back door of the K-9 unit¬†he hesitated for a moment then hopped in and SQUEEZED his body to turn-around and lay down across the back seat and IMMEDIATELY settled-in for the ride! It was a beautiful thing!¬†We later learned the officer took him to the local humane shelter and the owners retrieved him so alls well that ends well.¬†¬†He was beautiful albeit hard to read and makes me miss my dog-owner-days!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(1.0, 0.0))</td><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>1756498.0</td><td>Heres what I will say: thank you for producing a very well done short introductory film with two fine women who have devoted their lives to the betterment of this specific breed. There are likely to be thousands of ignorant and uninformed uneducated bias-ridden comments on any of your video threads particularly some of these rarer breeds that have been referred to as bastardized. These are coming from people who generally do not understand the real concept of what preservation breeding truly means and the devotion it takes to protect a breed and better it with each generation especially having come from a virtually extinct gene pool. People who rally around bashing anything on the Internet I find rely heavily on said resource to inform what they know about a breed (or various other topic). If you do not own train breed medically treat or fervently study any breed of dog you are not an expert on it. Relying on various social media platforms to properly and thoroughly educate individuals on all that was is and will be a Shar-Pei is an unfathomable notion. I celebrate this video and who stand behind it‚Äîthis information is correct but it is also only a 25 minute long feature that highlights the most significant information for the average person. I encourage everyone that feels so inclined to say they know this breed and make claims that are unfounded to take a step back and ask themselves really how educated and unbiased they are because most of the comments I read are riddled with opinions that are not founded on experience or proper study. Go to a library go to a dog history museum go to the breed clubs historians read books; go to shows and ask the people who are handling the dogs youre interested in. This video channel is a fabulous resource and I applaud the effort put into all the videos but its just a starting point for each breed. The Chinese Shar-Pei standard can be found on the breed club website cspca.com and it fully serves as the proper educational and historical resource the breed bashers should really consider investigating. Its too bad the Internet social media and backyard breeders have painted such a negative view of my breed in so manys eyes. This is not what the purpose of preservation breeding is supposed to be: its about keeping the health and temperament at the forefront of the breeders minds in protecting the dogs and keeping their history alive. Calling them useless I personally found completely harsh and offensive especially considering that I take mine to obedience class every week do therapy programs and am training for agility with my female. They are highly intelligent and purposeful breeding preserves their all purpose farm dog capabilities and you are foolish if you choose to believe that they are weak soft stupid or unsound as a generalization of the breed. Well socialized and hand reared Shar-Pei puppies are non such a thing. They may be fixated on their one person but a sound dog is never overly timid fearful or aggressive. Assertive powerful smart and excessively loyal... they can do it all if you invite them to it and I cannot overstate how significant the natural guarding and protection ability inherently withdraws from my dogs when they feel I am being threatened or challenged. To my friends who poured a lot into this video thank you. To all else who choose to explore the breed more I encourage you to do so... without relying on only one source of information. That is never a way to become an expert on anything; especially if you have no experience with it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.3857677902621723, 0.6142322097378277))</td><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>1854347.0</td><td>I love all dogs and my dog Rollo so much!

A family bought him as a 9month pup for a gift to their 5yearold with cancer. Unfortunately the little girl didnt live to meet him and for the mother it was too heartbreaking to keep him. So she was going to dump him in the nearest shelter.My family happened to be visiting the day she was going to dump him and we were able to take him in ourselves. In February he turned six and is a very happy healthy stubborn butt head haha.The second is a BorderCollie/Lab mix named Pepper. He was a stray that wandered in December during the worst freeze wed seen. He was soaking wet starving half frozen and very much afraid.We couldnt approach him at first he would get so scared hed trip over himself trying to run away.But he eventually warmed up to us and told us this by sitting in front of the door weeping poor baby! We let him inside to get warm and dry gave him some food as well. He was still pretty scared so I personally sat by him for the next five hours gently petting him. We identified his age as a little more than a year.Him and Jack get along fairly well and we realized we accidentally gave them a cheesy names. Pepper JackBoth are happy and healthy. They sleep in my room and Pepper paws at you until you pet him. The longer we had him the more we found signs of abuse. Which is likely why he was so terrified. Hes still pretty shy but also very loving!I love both my dogs very much!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>663646.0</td><td>flash looks like my dog sassy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>746663.0</td><td>Kona is my dogs name he is a cockapoo</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>761115.0</td><td>i just got 2 kittens and seeing this hurts me and i am glad my cats wont ever have to go to something like taht</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>816004.0</td><td>i was going to release my dog today but im not so sure anymore</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>823880.0</td><td>I cryd thay sounded just like my dog he cryd and cryd and i askd my g ma for him and she seid yes and he stopd i was so happy we where so happy i cryd watching this its so sad that thair mom left themüò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>914662.0</td><td>If you guys found a dog thats White and she has kind of curly fur and a pink nose that my dog name Emma I MISS HER SOOOOOO MUCH!!!!üò¢üò¢üò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üòîüòû</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>934576.0</td><td>my puppy passed away today someone hit him with a car and messed up his spinal cord and he had to be put down ~ June 26 2017</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>960433.0</td><td>This video made me cry because I lost my dog and to think he could be down there somewhere makes me so sad.

That said vibration for some reason every since I started the conditioning with her she just stops everything and lays down.  I didnt train that or anything that has just always been her natural reaction so I just left that and when she gets distracted and I need her attention vibrate.  Anyway I had a question with how to help my dog stay calm with other people.  When someone comes over she just gets super excited and does this cry whimper noise.  She will eventually calm down but I would rather a barking alert when someone comes to the house not an overly excited whimpering dog wanting attention.

I was 10 years old when he arrived to the family. My father summoned me and my big bro to the living room with a suprise hidden inside his jacket. Just when he mentioned the word surprise his tiny little head came out just like a baby kangaroo. He was so small 2 months and he was wearing a white sock as a jacket. He was trembling but very happy to receive our deepest love. We grew up together for 11 years vaccines trips to the beach trips to the mall -you name it. Everything. Until one day he disappeared from the house during a family meeting. Nobody noticed because the house was big and the dog was very independent. After a couple of hours a complete stranger knocked the door of our house. He said do you have a dog with these characteristics? and after agreement he asked me to follow him to the next street because he saw my dog. I was worried but the worse was yet to come. He was there lying on the dirt bleeding with flies and ants around his wounds. His wounds were not fresh. Another dog bit him. And so like a father I dived for his son grabbed him ran home and yelled thank you to that stranger. I madly drove Kemiur to the vet and he did his best diagnosis but the answer was heart-breaking: He is not going to make it. Im sorry. With tears on my eyes I agreed to the most painful acknowledgement a father can agree with. Put him to sleep. He lived 11 years with us and now I personally buried him.

But nope I was too busy choking or yanking my dog on a prong collar;¬†she became extremely paranoid and pre-emptively aggressive any time a person or dog came in sight or she so much as *thought* another person or dog was present - it could be a garbage bag/can on the side of the road a tree/bush a shadow a sound of any sort that resembled footsteps or a collar/tags jingling. So many different things became potential triggers and my dog was basically psychotic from this sort of training/treatment.Shes still an anxious dog and I dont think that will change¬†- I dont think my dog will ever be what she could have been - but at least now she can predict what is going to happen in most common situations. An unfamiliar dog appears - treats are delivered or we quickly go through some fun Rally-O¬†moves or tricks¬†- Front get ready heel sit get in or Spin wave beg¬†take a bow¬†- treat treat treat. Fun stuff happens. And she will never be on a choke or prong again - her reaction to being on a harness or gentle leader is so much different. Even on a flat collar she still gets uncomfortable because she feels that conditioned emotional response to pressure on her throat.Anyways Im so glad I found better ways. Glad you do what you do. Keep on! Sorry for my random long comment. Every now and then I like to explain my background with my dog a bit another thing that drives me crazy is when people dont think I know what theyre talking about when it comes to corrections and the training tools they use. No I get it... I just know better now.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.09635213586344338, 0.9036478641365566))</td><td>Pawfessor</td><td>1563715.0</td><td>When you said that throwing food in front of a dog and having them leave it is advanced I got really proud of my dog and the work Ive put in to training him.

I have been through something similar. I was losing fish went from 15 to 4 in a very short amount of time and I was trying everything to save them. It turned out to be my tap water. I got it tested and it contained a chemical from algae that while not harmful to humans it is deadly to fish. I contacted my towns local water district but got no where. I almost gave up on the hobby. I just felt totally defeated. I seriously considered just quitting. I didnt though. Ultimately I had to just get a whole home water filter system that I could hook my Python hose up to. It has 3 filters with the last one being a carbon and resin block to pull out the toxin. It worked and I was not only able to save my last 4 fish but eventually I got new fish and now have happy healthy fish again. Just know you are not alone we all have things happen no matter how careful we are. I had been in the hobby 20 years before my catastrophe happened but it happened and watching your videos along with others helped me realize that sometimes things just happen in the hobby and you cant let it beat you.

Growing up I lived in an area with no stray cats at all and I never saw another cat in the neighborhood.  We did live on a kind of busy road but not too busy and my cat happily went inside and out for his whole life.  Generally he just wanted to go outside and sit in the sun.  When he was younger hed roam more and fight but he lived to be almost 25 so it didnt harm him.Where I live now Id NEVER let my cats outside!  There are stray cats everywhere which is a huge vector for disease there are tons of fleas and ticks which is also a vector for disease.  IMO the rule of thumb has to be it depends on the cat and it depends on where you live.  Some cats are street smart and some arent and imo a road with no traffic is probably more dangerous than a road with a lot of traffic where cats deal with cars all the time.  But its always safer to keep them inside.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.2, 0.8))</td><td>Solid Gold Aquatics</td><td>2173360.0</td><td>I live in a rural area on a 5 acre property and my cats have always been free to do as they like indoors and outdoors.

A few months before he underwent two surgeries to remove a strange lump/cyst in his neck and I believe that might have cause a strain on his heart. He was seven years old and has been in perfect health throughout his whole life. Sometimes theres nothing you can do and we as humans shouldnt be egoistic and keep our animals alive if they suffer. Dont listen to the haters! P.S. I watch your channel since I could never keep pets like yours for myself.

There the vet said she was only feeling bad because of the climate and that she needed to be in a fresh place and so we did that... She didnt get better by night and I think I saw it coming cause I had a really long talk with her about our future. Around 4:00 am Sunday she died and that really tore me up. We were a full week not knowing what happened to her and by that time we were putting three puppies (of another couple of dogs) for adoption and one of them fell very sick when playing with a toy that used to be of Camila. We took them to another vet where we finally found out what had happened... It was Canine Parvovirus... We managed to save the three puppies and found them a home. But just knowing that I couldve saved my little Camila if I had known what she had breaks me every night.

Your can you groom my dog? video brought me to your channel and you definitely changed my perspective on pet ownership for the better. I have learned so much from you and you have made me appreciate love and care for animals so much more.  when i was younger i used to have the occasional fish (which died very quickly) but after being a fan of yours for a while you inspired me to get a big tank like yours and care for many fish. Im a beginner so i got a beta fish instead but i did everything i could to make sure its in a healthy and stable habitat and i made sure to inform my mother about every last detail about his PROPER care. Its been about 6 months and he is still alive and well! Thanks to you!

I freaked out confused how the heck the turtle came from and I still to this day dont know where it came from. I showed my parents and so we took it out and I checked what gender it was and it was a female and was a red eared slider (I live in Texas) I kept her a while my parents bought me a big aquarium with all the good things and i took good care of her. Yet she didnt grow I then realize the aquarium we got doesnt have a good heating lamp. I realized I could afford the actual good lamp to help her grow. Luckily my aunt and uncle are good animal keepers and said they would gladly take her. A couple weeks ago I gave her away to them and they showed me pictures and I almost teared up seeing her swimming and living a good life . If your wondering why I didnt put her back in the wild she was so small. Maybe even smaller then these turtles. Idk when she hatched but I couldnt just let a small baby turtle back in the wild and all the ponds near me have snakes and other turtles but I didnt want her to die because she was a sweet turtle. Sorry for such a long story about my turtle. Also I love u Taylor! <3</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.1289237668161435, 0.8710762331838565))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>1856554.0</td><td>I had 2 crabs they died ah its fine I have a dog Im happy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.2, 0.8))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>1856554.0</td><td>oh and they died because I was depresped and just wanted to give up on pets because iv had 6 crab but they all died at lest I have a dog and a lot of cats who want one come pick them up I have kittens to 4 lettries</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.1289237668161435, 0.8710762331838565))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>1897220.0</td><td>The black and white kitty looks exactly like my cat named Milo</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(1.0, 0.0))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>1948917.0</td><td>Theres a chain pet store where I live that takes rodent and reptile rescues (animals that would otherwise be abandoned or not cared for well) or doesnt have any pets for sale at all.

She had an eye infection and was a liter of a ferral(?) cat and they basically ate the food we put outside for them because we already had 2 cats of our own at the time. And one stood out. She kept running into walls and lost balance a lot. My sister was able to catch her and my mom already had dealt with a cat eye infection before so we were able to use anything from our last infection on the kitten. And basically that night I got instantly attached to her. She would come to me climb up on my shoulder and she would CONSTANTLY and STILL does today at 1 licks my face and my ear. We fed her kitten food and she slept in my room in a little dog crate we had temporary for a rabbit. She was so quick at using the restroom and she slept through the entire night. We instantly became inseparable. I would come home from school to a screaming kitten and wanting to play when I run through the door and excited to play with her.  She not only became attached to me but to my dog. She now grooms him sleeps next to him sleeps on his her and always follows him around. We eventually caught her two other sisters one we gave to our neighbor/my moms best friend and the other one we kept. We were gonna give her away because she would always hide under the couch and was just so cereal. It took us 3 months for her to finally come around and now her and my mom love each other. They are such a blessing in my life and seeing Nemo grow up reminds me so much of them when they were kittens. Also Taylor  you dont need to be sorry for not uploading its fine! We love you!

tends to get caught on low lying branches and thicker brush that I walk through also I tend to go scouting in other areas besides my woods I dont hunt but my father does so I usually go into woods that could run for miles with him and when your walking for hours on end as you may know can be hard with nothing more then a small bag on your side. ¬†Heres the thing my bag has been out in the rain while I was at a lake near my house before so its seen much better days especially now that its strap is wearing out. ¬†Plus I fish and am a starting photographer so when I wouldnt be using the bag in the woods it will probably be holding lures weights a smaller net and some pliers of course. ¬†And its hard to take an entire bucket on the back of an ATV down to the lake when I want to fish somewhere other then my pond. ¬†Another issue is when I want to take one of our labs Tera with me then I need even more supplies such as extra water bottles dog food and some small bowls plus depending where we are going a leash and harness so I believe this bag would just make everything easier plus I havent read the Coyote book yet and have been wanting to considering how much I have loved animals and still do since I was just a little girl and even now as Im entering high school iv still never met an animal I have hated despite being lunged at by a a copperhead snake while I was watching my dog swim in the pond. ¬†Thank you so much for reading this and good luck to everyone!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.28748760974345594,

brought in by Coyote climbing the Sting Pain Index I stayed for the great personalities on the channel. Honestly I havent felt this connected to really good nature content since I was a kid growing up watching Steve Irwin and the Kratt brothers. The quality of the channel is incredible the shots are great the episodes are funny and informative. I came out of a really bad spot in my life last year which included being homeless in a tent in a foot of snow and when I look at myself now with my own apartment my cat a job and things I own and a great support network watching shows that make me feel good and help me learn more about the beauty of the world its a really good feeling. A couple months ago I even got a tattoo thats now a forest forearm sleeve thats going to go up into mountains and a night sky that just really celebrates the beauty of the West Coast.And what Id use the adventure pack for? Im not gonna lie to you - itll probably mostly be on display. Ive been collecting books of people I admire and supporting their work and the Brave Adventures book would totally look great in my meager but growing collection. But for the most part itll travel with me in the summer while I show my boyfriend and friend the beauty of my corner of Canadas Southwest coast. Gonna go to the aquarium and Science World and maybe the planetarium cruise Stanley Park head out on the ferry. Fun stuff where I could absolutely use the pack to carry water and snacks and other such things.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.21921939439886134, 0.7807806056011386))</td><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>1712429.0</td><td>all I did was play wrestle with my dog for the 5 years Ive owned her and she does go for the forearm. she knew what to do instantly.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.22189037114020804, 0.778109628859792))</td><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>1777036.0</td><td>I have a dog named turtle.

My dog was 13 y.o. when she died of cancer. I was completely devastated and cried a lot. She never came to me in my dreams even though i asked her.  She died in November and in March my cat who was only 14 years old got sick and passed away literally in two days. It was really weird because everything went terribly wrong when he got sick and it felt like he was destine to die. I was totally heartbroken. I missed him so much that for whatever reason i thought that if i would go to a shelter and adopt a cat that looks like him i would get my cat back. That was exactly what i did. I went to a few shelters and one of them had one large cat room where you could walk in and pet the cats they were offering for adoption. I went inside and petted a cat who looked very similar to the cat i had.  This cat looked at me and climbed on my shoulders. I put her back on a bench but she climbed on my shoulders again and  she was rubbing herself against my neck. People who worked at that shelter were literally stunned because she did not do that to anyone. I adopted her and brought her home. At first i was disappointed because in my disturbed mind at that time i thought that she would have the same personality as my deceased cat but her personality was completely different. As i got to know her better it totally hit me that she acts absolutely like my dog that passed away in November.  Everyone who knew that dog also noticed that.  I believe that this cat is actually my reincarnated dog. Her soul went to the body of this cat and she came back to me. By the way since i brought her home she never jumped on my shoulders like she did it in the shelter.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.14888055202212383, 0.8511194479778762))</td><td>Brent Atwater</td><td>770628.0</td><td>Thank you so much for your videos.

Ive always been non believer. I always felt guilty because Im convinced I didnt do enough for him and I scolded him sometimes for things that werent his fault. Soon after his death he started to visit me in my dreams. The first dream I had was horrible he looked fine and healthy but when I tried to pet him he turned skin and bones almost a skeleton. The following visits were better he stil looked old and dirty but he was always eating and he didnt look like he was suffering and I felt like he never died and he just returned from where I never realized in my dreams. Every time he visited me I always woke up crying and I went on crying for the whole following day I dont even know why.Its been a lot since the last time he visited me the last night I thought just that I havent seen my cat since a whole year now I would love if he could visit me again... and that night he visited me again stil looking sick but he was eating a lot and looking happy overall and it was like he never died. I knew in my dream that he was 26 years old and I kept saying we need to call the vet and get the surgery done this time or his condition will get worse... The vet will be very surprised on his improvements though he put on a lot of weight and he looks like a different cat from the last time the vet came... why did the vet came last time? He just looked at him and did nothing how weird (in reality the last time the vet came it was to put him down)... and that morning I wake up and started crying again and now I realized that my cat stopped visiting me because he didnt want to make me cry every time he showed up. Do you think its that the reason he didnt came more often?

And I dont mean adequately giving them the basics: food water etc. I mean when you get to the point that your attention can not be divided any further.  Its also a matter of whats important to you.  Somebody who spends their time at work out with friends shopping etc. would say holy shit you have too many pets how do you do it? I can do it because I WANT to give my extra time to them. Between classes? I dont go to the mall I take my dogs to a park.  Its all about whats important to you.  I want to come home and pet my cats.  Curl up in bed with a pile of fluff.  People say how can you afford it? Again. Its all about where you choose to put your money.  I would much rather spend my extra money on good dog food cat toys things for my snakes terrarium than on expensive clothes or shoes or makeup.  Id rather save money for vet appointments than vacations.  Its just. I donno. Its that animal loving gene you were talking about. Some people get it or they dont.  As for do you have too many pets?  You have too many when you start forgetting their names and oh yeah! I have a bearded dragon over here. If you have the time and WANT to greet and spend time with each of your pets at the shop.

Without thinking I flung open my door and greeted him with a big HEY FELLA what cha doing cmere!! and he barked just ONE HUGE BARK but didnt gesture towards me (like he was greeting me in response). He stood looking at me but also looking toward our back deck where 2 outdoor cats were watching his every move. He was more intrigued by them than me and half-trotted around back to investigate - but definitely not looking to kill them so I turned back inside and met him out the back porch door. By then the¬†cats disappeared so I proffered him a huge pot of beef stew Id intended to give the cats and he happily gobbled it up but since he was JET black and didnt have a tail I couldnt read him the way Id always read my dogs in the past. Hed let out a bark every now & then while we interacted but he wasnt barking at me so I offered him scoops of cat kibbles and checked out his collar but found it didnt have any¬†tags so I had my hubby hand me our old Saint Bernards FlexiLeash & call the town police but either seeing the leash or my hubby made the Mastiff¬†bark as-if he was upset so I hid the leash and my hubby went¬†inside behind the door. It must have been my hubby that upset him because as soon as he was done¬†eating the last of the cat kibbles¬†I sat on a lawn chair and¬†he sat ON my feet with his back to me and lifted his head up and looked at me upside down...and then he proceeded to lay down all sprawled out/still ON my feet but very relaxed so I hooked his collar to the leash and awaited the town police. When the¬†officer arrived the dog barked at him a lot but didnt make any attempt to¬†get off the deck to get him. He just hung around by me barking at the officer thru the deck railing.¬†He asked if I could walk the dog to his patrol car but¬†not knowing if the dog liked the leash or not I suggested instead that he back-up the patrol car right to the deck to make it a very short little walk... and when hed backed-up the car¬†he stayed in the front and I hung out with the Mastiff until he had calmed down/stopped barking since the officer was out of sight and then I asked him WANNA GO OUT? WANNA GO OUT¬†IN THE CAR?! and he took a look at¬†the leash and the car and TOTALLY GOT THE POINT and he did a funny sorta PRANCE like he was EXCITED & WANTED to go¬†for the road trip but a PRANCING GIANT BULL MASTIFF is almost indistinguishable from a pissed-off GIANT BULL MASTIFF so¬†initially for a split second I thought he was going to leap up and¬†eat my face off so I was RELIEVED when his PRANCING turned into a BEELINE straight for the patrol car with me in tow sorta like a water-skier LOL! He stopped at the back door of the patrol car as he apparently knew the drill VERY WELL; when I opened the¬†back door of the K-9 unit¬†he hesitated for a moment then hopped in and SQUEEZED his body to turn-around and lay down across the back seat and IMMEDIATELY settled-in for the ride! It was a beautiful thing!¬†We later learned the officer took him to the local humane shelter and the owners retrieved him so alls well that ends well.¬†¬†He was beautiful albeit hard to read and makes me miss my dog-owner-days!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5041993738735916, 0.49580062612640835))</td><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>1756498.0</td><td>Heres what I will say: thank you for producing a very well done short introductory film with two fine women who have devoted their lives to the betterment of this specific breed. There are likely to be thousands of ignorant and uninformed uneducated bias-ridden comments on any of your video threads particularly some of these rarer breeds that have been referred to as bastardized. These are coming from people who generally do not understand the real concept of what preservation breeding truly means and the devotion it takes to protect a breed and better it with each generation especially having come from a virtually extinct gene pool. People who rally around bashing anything on the Internet I find rely heavily on said resource to inform what they know about a breed (or various other topic). If you do not own train breed medically treat or fervently study any breed of dog you are not an expert on it. Relying on various social media platforms to properly and thoroughly educate individuals on all that was is and will be a Shar-Pei is an unfathomable notion. I celebrate this video and who stand behind it‚Äîthis information is correct but it is also only a 25 minute long feature that highlights the most significant information for the average person. I encourage everyone that feels so inclined to say they know this breed and make claims that are unfounded to take a step back and ask themselves really how educated and unbiased they are because most of the comments I read are riddled with opinions that are not founded on experience or proper study. Go to a library go to a dog history museum go to the breed clubs historians read books; go to shows and ask the people who are handling the dogs youre interested in. This video channel is a fabulous resource and I applaud the effort put into all the videos but its just a starting point for each breed. The Chinese Shar-Pei standard can be found on the breed club website cspca.com and it fully serves as the proper educational and historical resource the breed bashers should really consider investigating. Its too bad the Internet social media and backyard breeders have painted such a negative view of my breed in so manys eyes. This is not what the purpose of preservation breeding is supposed to be: its about keeping the health and temperament at the forefront of the breeders minds in protecting the dogs and keeping their history alive. Calling them useless I personally found completely harsh and offensive especially considering that I take mine to obedience class every week do therapy programs and am training for agility with my female. They are highly intelligent and purposeful breeding preserves their all purpose farm dog capabilities and you are foolish if you choose to believe that they are weak soft stupid or unsound as a generalization of the breed. Well socialized and hand reared Shar-Pei puppies are non such a thing. They may be fixated on their one person but a sound dog is never overly timid fearful or aggressive. Assertive powerful smart and excessively loyal... they can do it all if you invite them to it and I cannot overstate how significant the natural guarding and protection ability inherently withdraws from my dogs when they feel I am being threatened or challenged. To my friends who poured a lot into this video thank you. To all else who choose to explore the breed more I encourage you to do so... without relying on only one source of information. That is never a way to become an expert on anything; especially if you have no experience with it.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.562754290803914, 0.43724570919608585))</td><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>1854347.0</td><td>I love all dogs and my dog Rollo so much!

He was soaking wet starving half frozen and very much afraid.We couldnt approach him at first he would get so scared hed trip over himself trying to run away.But he eventually warmed up to us and told us this by sitting in front of the door weeping poor baby! We let him inside to get warm and dry gave him some food as well. He was still pretty scared so I personally sat by him for the next five hours gently petting him. We identified his age as a little more than a year.Him and Jack get along fairly well and we realized we accidentally gave them a cheesy names. Pepper JackBoth are happy and healthy. They sleep in my room and Pepper paws at you until you pet him. The longer we had him the more we found signs of abuse. Which is likely why he was so terrified. Hes still pretty shy but also very loving!I love both my dogs very much!</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.2775952519599908, 0.7224047480400092))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>663646.0</td><td>flash looks like my dog sassy</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.21768886477661442, 0.7823111352233856))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>746663.0</td><td>Kona is my dogs name he is a cockapoo</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.14888055202212383, 0.8511194479778762))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>761115.0</td><td>i just got 2 kittens and seeing this hurts me and i am glad my cats wont ever have to go to something like taht</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.28453368666990303, 0.7154663133300969))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>816004.0</td><td>i was going to release my dog today but im not so sure anymore</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.3732595684016122, 0.6267404315983878))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>823880.0</td><td>I cryd thay sounded just like my dog he cryd and cryd and i askd my g ma for him and she seid yes and he stopd i was so happy we where so happy i cryd watching this its so sad that thair mom left themüò¢üò¢üò¢üò¢</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.25359507199708664, 0.7464049280029135))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>914662.0</td><td>If you guys found a dog thats White and she has kind of curly fur and a pink nose that my dog name Emma I MISS HER SOOOOOO MUCH!!!!üò¢üò¢üò¢üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üòîüòû</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.3295758651675353, 0.6704241348324647))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>934576.0</td><td>my puppy passed away today someone hit him with a car and messed up his spinal cord and he had to be put down ~ June 26 2017</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.20746482068621536, 0.7925351793137847))</td><td>Hope For Paws - Official Rescue Channel</td><td>960433.0</td><td>This video made me cry because I lost my dog and to think he could be down there somewhere makes me so sad.

Ive also got a 3 stray cats in a alley way to trust me and rub all over me and stuff like that. I recently took care of a black half tailed kitten that was starving because the owners werent feeding her.......I know their neice and she said that the cat is just there to hang around and get pregnant. So I started feeding her and I named her Jamaica .....she was my best cat friend she would follow me everywhere and hang out with me.....then she got pregnant and THEN the owners started caring for her.....I miss her. Also people with outdoor cats.....the cats always follow me or come up to me and only me.......I must be a Disney princessüòÇ</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.1707485543237602, 0.8292514456762398))</td><td>Jackson Galaxy</td><td>2402149.0</td><td>Come to Brazil please !!

That said vibration for some reason every since I started the conditioning with her she just stops everything and lays down.  I didnt train that or anything that has just always been her natural reaction so I just left that and when she gets distracted and I need her attention vibrate.  Anyway I had a question with how to help my dog stay calm with other people.  When someone comes over she just gets super excited and does this cry whimper noise.  She will eventually calm down but I would rather a barking alert when someone comes to the house not an overly excited whimpering dog wanting attention.

I was 10 years old when he arrived to the family. My father summoned me and my big bro to the living room with a suprise hidden inside his jacket. Just when he mentioned the word surprise his tiny little head came out just like a baby kangaroo. He was so small 2 months and he was wearing a white sock as a jacket. He was trembling but very happy to receive our deepest love. We grew up together for 11 years vaccines trips to the beach trips to the mall -you name it. Everything. Until one day he disappeared from the house during a family meeting. Nobody noticed because the house was big and the dog was very independent. After a couple of hours a complete stranger knocked the door of our house. He said do you have a dog with these characteristics? and after agreement he asked me to follow him to the next street because he saw my dog. I was worried but the worse was yet to come. He was there lying on the dirt bleeding with flies and ants around his wounds. His wounds were not fresh. Another dog bit him. And so like a father I dived for his son grabbed him ran home and yelled thank you to that stranger. I madly drove Kemiur to the vet and he did his best diagnosis but the answer was heart-breaking: He is not going to make it. Im sorry. With tears on my eyes I agreed to the most painful acknowledgement a father can agree with. Put him to sleep. He lived 11 years with us and now I personally buried him.

It drives me insane when people say you dont know what youre talking about. You know exactly what youre talking about. You understand dog behaviour/learning to the key.

Youll always face adversity but thats normal thats part of it all its especially part of being successful; people will always wanna bring you down even if youre great.Omg that part where Chuck yells at his client LOOK AT HIM! HES LOOKING AT ME! HE HAS NO BUSINESS LOOKING AT ANYTHING! (Bla bla bla). WOW! What a crock of shit! Shitty trainers like that get dogs killed. This kind of training is¬†EXACTLY¬†what turned my own dog into a monster back in the¬†days when I didnt know any better and I somehow¬†thought this all made sense. I thought I had to correct the stare-down. I was even told I could correct my dog for having her hackles or tail up! I was TOLD that!¬†Instead I could have been click/rewarding my dog for looking at triggers. But nope I was too busy choking or yanking my dog on a prong collar;¬†she became extremely paranoid and pre-emptively aggressive any time a person or dog came in sight or she so much as *thought* another person or dog was present - it could be a garbage bag/can on the side of the road a tree/bush a shadow a sound of any sort that resembled footsteps or a collar/tags jingling. So many different things became potential triggers and my dog was basically psychotic from this sort of training/treatment.Shes still an anxious dog and I dont think that will change¬†- I dont think my dog will ever be what she could have been - but at least now she can predict what is going to happen in most common situations. An unfamiliar dog appears - treats are delivered or we quickly go through some fun Rally-O¬†moves or tricks¬†- Front get ready heel sit get in or Spin wave beg¬†take a bow¬†- treat treat treat. Fun stuff happens. And she will never be on a choke or prong again - her reaction to being on a harness or gentle leader is so much different. Even on a flat collar she still gets uncomfortable because she feels that conditioned emotional response to pressure on her throat.Anyways Im so glad I found better ways. Glad you do what you do. Keep on! Sorry for my random long comment. Every now and then I like to explain my background with my dog a bit another thing that drives me crazy is when people dont think I know what theyre talking about when it comes to corrections and the training tools they use. No I get it...

I almost gave up on the hobby. I just felt totally defeated. I seriously considered just quitting. I didnt though. Ultimately I had to just get a whole home water filter system that I could hook my Python hose up to. It has 3 filters with the last one being a carbon and resin block to pull out the toxin. It worked and I was not only able to save my last 4 fish but eventually I got new fish and now have happy healthy fish again.

Growing up I lived in an area with no stray cats at all and I never saw another cat in the neighborhood.  We did live on a kind of busy road but not too busy and my cat happily went inside and out for his whole life.  Generally he just wanted to go outside and sit in the sun.  When he was younger hed roam more and fight but he lived to be almost 25 so it didnt harm him.Where I live now Id NEVER let my cats outside!  There are stray cats everywhere which is a huge vector for disease there are tons of fleas and ticks which is also a vector for disease.  IMO the rule of thumb has to be it depends on the cat and it depends on where you live.  Some cats are street smart and some arent and imo a road with no traffic is probably more dangerous than a road with a lot of traffic where cats deal with cars all the time.  But its always safer to keep them inside.</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>0.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.5341258983170973, 0.4658741016829027))</td><td>Solid Gold Aquatics</td><td>2173360.0</td><td>I live in a rural area on a 5 acre property and my cats have always been free to do as they like indoors and outdoors.

A few months before he underwent two surgeries to remove a strange lump/cyst in his neck and I believe that might have cause a strain on his heart. He was seven years old and has been in perfect health throughout his whole life. Sometimes theres nothing you can do and we as humans shouldnt be egoistic and keep our animals alive if they suffer.

There the vet said she was only feeling bad because of the climate and that she needed to be in a fresh place and so we did that... She didnt get better by night and I think I saw it coming cause I had a really long talk with her about our future. Around 4:00 am Sunday she died and that really tore me up. We were a full week not knowing what happened to her and by that time we were putting three puppies (of another couple of dogs) for adoption and one of them fell very sick when playing with a toy that used to be of Camila. We took them to another vet where we finally found out what had happened... It was Canine Parvovirus... We managed to save the three puppies and found them a home.

I showed my parents and so we took it out and I checked what gender it was and it was a female and was a red eared slider (I live in Texas) I kept her a while my parents bought me a big aquarium with all the good things and i took good care of her. Yet she didnt grow I then realize the aquarium we got doesnt have a good heating lamp. I realized I could afford the actual good lamp to help her grow. Luckily my aunt and uncle are good animal keepers and said they would gladly take her. A couple weeks ago I gave her away to them and they showed me pictures and I almost teared up seeing her swimming and living a good life . If your wondering why I didnt put her back in the wild she was so small. Maybe even smaller then these turtles. Idk when she hatched but I couldnt just let a small baby turtle back in the wild and all the ponds near me have snakes and other turtles but I didnt want her to die because she was a sweet turtle.

She had an eye infection and was a liter of a ferral(?) cat and they basically ate the food we put outside for them because we already had 2 cats of our own at the time. And one stood out. She kept running into walls and lost balance a lot. My sister was able to catch her and my mom already had dealt with a cat eye infection before so we were able to use anything from our last infection on the kitten. And basically that night I got instantly attached to her. She would come to me climb up on my shoulder and she would CONSTANTLY and STILL does today at 1 licks my face and my ear. We fed her kitten food and she slept in my room in a little dog crate we had temporary for a rabbit. She was so quick at using the restroom and she slept through the entire night. We instantly became inseparable. I would come home from school to a screaming kitten and wanting to play when I run through the door and excited to play with her.  She not only became attached to me but to my dog. She now grooms him sleeps next to him sleeps on his her and always follows him around. We eventually caught her two other sisters one we gave to our neighbor/my moms best friend and the other one we kept. We were gonna give her away because she would always hide under the couch and was just so cereal. It took us 3 months for her to finally come around and now her and my mom love each other. They are such a blessing in my life and seeing Nemo grow up reminds me so much of them when they were kittens. Also Taylor  you dont need to be sorry for not uploading its fine! We love you! And I hope you get the rest you need to get a full and healthy recovery from ear infections and colds and fevers. üòä</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>1.0</td><td>List(1, 2, List(), List(0.15153366109334945, 0.8484663389066505))</td><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>2471304.0</td><td>please name the boy buddlynn or buddy for short cause thats what my cat looked like but...

My dad has kept fish since he was a child - my grandad even kept fish that have since become illegal to import into the UK and they both had dogs growing up [my grandad had a gorgeous Pyrenees x St Bernard]. Weve had 8 cats 3 dogs 6 rats 5 guinea pigs chinese water dragon crested gecko poison dart frogs stick insects crabs and too many fish currently 5 cats 3 dogs and the fish [though I plan to get a ball python soon]. When I move out I want to limit myself more than my parents have. I would love to have a ball python a dog or two some fish and maybe a mexican black kingsnake and rats again [which compared to the pets we have now doesnt sound like a lot]. Ive found that Ill make any excuse to look at animals be it ducks at the lake pets in a pet store zoos which does frustrate my friends and bore my family but its one of the few things that Im passionate about and as long as owners can provide care for their animals it shouldnt matter whether someone else thinks they have too many.</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Gnat

The four places in history that developed writing systems were due to having actual needs - agriculture for growing communities required more brain power than individuals could muster.  They needed to offload their past learning into written documents.  This way new people can learn what to do without bugging the few people already know effectively creating government ordinances.  Seeing the power of communicating across distances some people borrowed the governments writing system and tailored it for their own purposes.  The most effective motivator for learning to read and write has always been a government requiring someone to understand a writing system under punishment of losing money.I believe writing to be useful as an alternate rendering of ideas.  Yes ASL videos capture your meaning accurately for someone who knows ASL.  It has a lot of nuance that culturally literate people may notice.  But the closed captions are there to eliminate the nuances.  You use standard spelling and proper grammar so others can look up your meaning even if they are not culturally literate English speakers.If you had published your captions in a blog post people can actually read four times faster than your speech / signing.  I could skim the paragraphs of the blog post quickly looking for something that is relevant to me.  It can be indexed by Google or I can just use the Find feature in my browser for particular words.  It can be automatically (though poorly) translated into hundreds of other languages.  I can print it out and highlight parts of it for review later.  Dictionary writers encyclopedias magazines books newspapers etc. can use your blog post as source material.ASLWrite or Si5s could realize these kind benefits.  My personal take is that an alphabet is better than picture writing because it doubles as an index.  I created the ASLSJ writing system because I wanted to use ASL words in my computer programs.  It only uses the alphabets letters so I could upload the closed captions for your video in ASLSJ today.Your video starts with the ASL word hello.  In English each letter of a word phonetically tells you how to move your lips tongue and throat to pronounce the word.  In ASLSJ the word bepo-r phonetically tells you to put your open-B handshape (the first two letters - be) in front of your chin (the next letter - p) with the palm turned out (next letter - o) then move the hand to the right (-r).  bepo-r is an ASL idea.  It does not require translation into English and it does not require an artists painting like ASLWrite or Si5s.  Now I can create a dictionary to hold that word and thousands more.  Unfortunately it wouldnt help because nobody would want to read it - so were back to square one.</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>114368.0</td><td>so cute</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Brave Wilderness</td><td>114368.0</td><td>sorry for the turtleÔºåhe cant clean the bird poop on his own</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Dodo</td><td>114567.0</td><td>Omg!

We took him to the vet and he was put on fluids. They told us the cancer had most likely spread to his brain and he would have 2 weeks to live. We were devastated and my parents didnt want to spend money on any treatments so we took him home and were given phenobarbital for the seizures. As a last ditch effort we decided to change him onto a holistic diet. More than 2 weeks had passed and he was acting normal again but my stoner brother wanted to try CBD/THC oil to ease his pain.  That was the best decision we ever made. My dog used to have big tumors that would get punctured and bleed everywhere but we didnt want to put him through more surgeries to remove them and about 3 months after we started the oil the tumors started to shrink.  Now the only visible tumors are little ones on his tongue. I truly believe the cancer has gone into remission and Im so thankful my dog is still here and loving life. His 7th birthday is November 24th!!! I didnt think he would live as long as he has.  I definitely recommend the CBD and/or THC oil.  Going into this I did not think it would cure his cancer but it almost seems as if it has!

Hes so big hes just nudging her with his face and knocking her to the ground.  POWERFUL dog.  So Im trying to get us away but also trying to stop this fucking thing from possibly impregnating my dog.  Im a big guy but physically couldnt do a god damn thing about it.

Hes a little under 2yrs old but he knows he should not bite... that just doesnt stop him lol. If hes playing with a toy that youre holding hell commonly try to bite the toy as closely as possible to your hand (you can feel the side of his teeth) but you can tell hes trying to not actively bite your hand. Eventually hell get frustrated enough and aim exclusively for your hand ignoring the toy completely. He still wants to play just not with the toy... just your hand lol. He learned to be careful about biting when hes getting treats though.The biggest problem for me is how he doesnt do well with people we are engaging with. Taking him for walks or drives hes usually okay with people passing by him. Doesnt bark wildly or anything but maybe hes curious about smell. If friends/family come over though we bring him to the groomers or to the vet hes a mad dog that will try to bite viciously if you approach him and were around. Apparently if we leave him for a little while (were not with him for at least 10min) hes almost like an angel the rest of the time. Not sure how to remedy his initial anger. Like hes in full defense mode and will even try to bite us. I guess it should also be noted he has a temper waking up or when hes sleepy. You cant try to carry him if hes lying down in that state otherwise hell try to viciously/wildly bite your hands. Likewise just petting him during those times. Hell start to flash his teeth and then bite if youre not careful. You can pretend youre trying to play with him though and when he shifts a little hes okay to be picked up. Hes usually not like that at all when hes awake though (outside of the ferocity hes at in those other cases though like the groomers or vet).</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Vet Ranch</td><td>2065544.0</td><td>my dogs name is Oliver</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Loki the Red Fox</td><td>2074085.0</td><td>Loki is just like my dog! he goes after anything moving! its a pain when you are trying to make a bed!</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Zak Georges Dog Training rEvolution</td><td>2106401.0</td><td>I love your book and videos and also have a 3 month old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

And parents who do not force the kids to stay away from them not pester them etc. I have never been a huge fan of indoor cats I think it is cruel to keep them indoors.

She is a great field mice catcher and ground squirrel catcher. She avoids all people except my husband my youngest adult child and myself.

Ive been able to teach him the basics but have faced problems fixing his destructive behaviour and whining.Ive a tiny mix breed puppy 8 months old but he has never ending energy even though he hardly eats(he just smells food and goes away) and we play with him a lot apart from two 2 kilometre walks a day. Ive tried tiring him up everyday but still he constantly craves for attention and when he gets that he wants to scratch and bite. Moreover if you do not pay attention to him hell start whining and can go on for half and hour or so. But the most troublesome part is his destructive behaviour. When we usually go out even for 15 ministers or so he starts tearing the wallpaper the bed covers and recently the wooden bathroom doors. Not only that but when we are home and not paying attention to him he makes a meal out of our flip flops and in one case my wifes watch! Weve tried everything from buying toys to treating him to making him wear a muzzle but he somehow always manages to destroy things.The worse part about it is the fact that he is well aware of his behaviour being unacceptable. As soon as I notice his recent destruction he starts shaking in fear but never stops tearing the house. Please give me some tips and suggestions on the situation. Itll be helpful.</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Peter Caine Dog Training</td><td>2509003.0</td><td>Petco trainers are mean my friend told me they told her to put pennies in a monster energy drink can and shake it to get the dogs attention they told her to get her dog on blue Buffalo it was recalled and her dog died within a week it was very sad she shouldnt have had the dog in the first place she didnt have the means to care for him the shelter threw it on her because he was gonna be put down she wanted a dog to service her but she didnt qualify for a service dog I met her through her dog my boss told me she would ban access of my service dog if I didnt train hers her dog was a boxer ridge back this dog was out of control he humped my dog in the face just a total goof but I finally did train him after seeing her try to go through pet co and seeing what they do I dont do dog food I do a raw diet for my dogs but she wasnt interested and it wasnt my dog to make her change her mind she doesnt have a animal anymore and I dont think she will ever get another after he died it was emoitional even for me his organs shut down with in a week and he died</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>ViralHog</td><td>2514921.0</td><td>If that was my cat Id surround him with cucumbers while he sleeps üòÇüòÇ</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>2527729.0</td><td>Me : *puts on dogs barking vid*My dog : *Snaps phone from hand*Me : AYYY!!!</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>83868.0</td><td>Im looking for a emotional support dog and I love the doberman breed.

I have been ill this past year and havent been following instagram or posting much but was wondering how Seymore was doing.  To see that you also have Sabrina is awesome. Gidget is doing great but we found out that she has a malformation in her jaw and lacks the ability to open nuts and seeds. Her physical issues require that I cut all her food small and open all her nuts and seeds. Ive found that a quick smash of a hammer breaks everything up but still requires her to work to get to the meat of the nuts and seeds. Unfortunately she is unable to be released as she now relies on me to prep her food. When my puppy found her in the yard at maybe 18 days old I committed to caring for her as long as she needed...if that means her entire life thats just fine. I dont feel wildlife should ever be caged and made into pets but sometimes they need our help. I have agreed to help rehab another orphan that a couple found in their yard and I am hoping after winter we can start the soft release process on my property. I live in an area where I can release them into the woods but also provide back-up shelter and food if they choose to stay close. Its a commitment like having a dog or cat but its so rewarding. Gidget is very domesticated now and lives a life where she is not caged 24/7 and has an entire room dedicated to her. She pretends to be a squirrel 90% of the time but she also loves to snuggle and play with her humans. The puppy that found her thinks that she is her puppy and they are very bonded to each other.  While she is super comfy with me and 2 of my dogs she is still very fearful of other humans and dogs...I have to limit my pet sitting now because it upsets her and she will hide for the duration of company visits.  Sabrina and Seymore are so lucky to have a caring human that chose to help them as opposed to euthanizing them...which was what I was told to do with Gidget. Even when the vet suggested it when he discovered why she couldnt Crack or open nuts I explained and promised her that I would care for her as long as she needed me...this spring we may allow her to spend some time in an outdoor enclosure that we will be building this winter for the new squirrel. We will revisit release options for Gidget once the threat of Winter is behind us. Unless I provide all her food and she doesnt leave the property she wont survive because she probably doesnt know how to defend herself...so...I doubt that will ever be an option for her...but she might enjoy hanging out in an enclosure where she is safe. For now Ill continue to prep her food daily and allow her to run the house and spend her time hanging out on one of her several 7ft tall cat trees and her huge 6x6x24 cage with 3 levels and swings and her pick of about 6 different nests Ive set up all over the house....can you say SPOILED SQUIRREL PRINCESS GIDGET???</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>best pets</td><td>2442520.0</td><td>I love border collies my dog Polly is a lab and she is not the smartest dog but she learned to sit and lay down easily</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>2444559.0</td><td>Maybe on your 100000 subs you should do a vlog with gohan??

Ive gotta add my two cents if you dont mind.I have to applaud your video I think it is very educational.I agree partly with the whole Youre breaking the law by bringing a dog thats not service trained into the store Thing but I also understand why you did it and I think its important that you did.BECAUSE people should keep in mind that your dog WAS in fact acting unlike a SD in the ways you stated: He was pulling at the leash showing interest in other people and not focusing on you. He did NOT however approach other dogs or pay much attention to them and I could tell that you redirected him by not even going near other pets in the store.By the way that one VERY dedicated commenter; it is not illegal to confront someone about their SD even if you are a citizen. If you believe the animal is not acting the way a service dog must in this example a retractable leash and the dog going wherever it wanted you have every right to ask the same question anyone else can: Is that a service dog? and What services does he perform? You can ask other questions (not advised and rude) but if someone cant answer either of those two (They dont have to of course but it is illegal to LIE about it) then it prooobably isnt a service dog.I consider it my responsibility as a citizen to keep myself and ESPECIALLY those with real SDs safe in this way; it is a right.Sorry @Gage OBrien about the long winded-ness but I really appreciate your video and hope you continue to make more on educated such as these.

You can train an animal without hurting them with positive reenforcement and lots of attention. Give them breaks from training or working when they need one! Ive had dogs my whole life. I dont beat my pups when they do something wrong. Ive taught them the word no. I use that when they do something they shouldnt with a very small tap on the rear end just enough so they connect the bad action with me being disappointed and never hard. Ive never shoved my dogs face in urine or anything. I successfully trained my two adult dogs who now live with my dad because hes retired and wanted something to keep him active I trained my brothers dog with him and Im training my two new pups the same as I always have-brief show of disapproval and then forgiveness. A pup their age can only know what theyre in trouble for at max about 20 minutes. Id rather positively show them not doing the specific action reaps a reward where doing the action means Im disappointed. When they do the opposite of the bad thing-they get a treat. Which backs up the I should do this because she likes when I do this enough to give me food and pets and belly rubs! Mind set. And the she DOESNT like that at all. I didnt get a treat and shes not petting me...and I was told to lay down and stay for doing that thing...maybe I shouldnt do it. Thought. Just like beating a kid doesnt really get you anything (but a case) where as showing the kid with them having a positive result in what you expect (school behavior sharing whatever youre teaching) reaps a reward. When my nieces behave well in the store with me (all under 8) they can pick out a juice or flavored water they want. But not behaving means no juices or flavored water. It only takes a warning for them to decide theyd rather behave and get something they want over misbehaving and not getting want they want.</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The Dodo</td><td>1074972.0</td><td>The idiots who have never seen an actual dog kill something versus me over here whos dog will do it for fun-the difference is I KNOW this dog wasnt going to harm it. A dog does not lick something it wants to kill. Sorry. My dog doesnt even think twice when she gets off leash by accident and sees a rabbit out near our house in the country. She chases it down bites its throat and walks away once its dead. Shes also killed birds bats groundhogs and cats. She doesnt play with nor rescue anything. Why she can only have one companion dog larger than her around (shes a mountain cur/chow mix) or she will try and bully it. There was ONE other dog she was fond of-a small very sweet chihuahua she never harmed. Thats it. She would lick the ears of the chihuahua even though she wasnt use to being around other dogs or not wanting to harm something. She did it on instinct. Now she does it with the GS/Husky mix. Also: that dog breed isnt a hunting breed its a herding type Im fairly certain. Which means it doesnt want to harm but herd.

The work you are doing about animal abuse that some people describe as training is second to none. I would ask thought that you find another phrase besides balanced trainers because not all trainers who use some sort of negative reinforcement fall into the category that you created when you show ABUSIVE TRAINERS. I personally do not use compulsion to train my dogs but I have in a setting that does not qualify as training. Just to be clear I rarely but occasionally correct my dog in everyday life when my training with them is not complete or if I know that they know what Im talking about but are testing boundaries. After all they are living creatures with brains so they will occasionally test boundaries. And again just to clarify I DONT HIT OR CAUSE ANY SERIOUS PAIN. I only use to get the attention of the dog.

One thing I love about them is how sensitive and loyal/caring they are to our emotions and feelings. My cats get all cuddly when they feel me stressed or upset and Ive heard many sweet stories of other animals picking up on our emotions and showing love. Anyways Its ok to ask for help.

We have stuck to the principles and yes she will jump on people barely listens you name it some demon has appeared she wants to play with everything they tell me it takes 2 years with Aussies that they are unique clearly we have missed something. There are days I see her at her best but it is very infrequent definitely a trial of wills she is extremely affectionate and sweet. We think she wants to herd the world with her love a really baby.

As I watched your video I laughed because my sisters dog Bella a Labradoodle has some of the behaviors of your special girl Brante. Bella wants to play all the time and she will swim in the pool for hours fetching and returning frisbees and balls. Its odd for me to encounter a dog who looks like a poodle behave more like a working dog such as the Lab that is inside her. Mals are beautiful and purposeful and youve made a perfect video demonstrating the pros and cons of owning such a majestic breed. I would have made the same mistakes in training as you had made because I would just want to hug her too! I hug all my dogs because as you said I love them.I recently lost Mia my precious German Shepherd I rescued 11 years ago. She had the uncanny determination powerful will and heightened intelligence of your Brante. There were a myriad amount of fascinating attributes that I discovered about Mia. However during her explosive bouts of play she was very gentle with me. Giving her the football or pointedly feeding her a snack from my hand she was very mindful that my hand being close to her mouth and gently took the food without ever biting my fingers. She knew the difference between the food and my hand. Sometimes She would allow me to drop the food into her mouth. When you spoke about losing your dog of 15 years I understand how you feel. It is abundantly clear that you are a kindred spirit. Thank you for making this video and if she will allow please give Brante a hug from me. üêïüêæüíï</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Steel The Husky</td><td>1953428.0</td><td>I got my dog that same toy awhile ago she never took squirrels out not really but she did basically destroy the house  the sides of it she made holes and stuffing is coming out everywhere and plays with everything separately but the squirrels she loves they are still one with no holes but the house well yeah</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>2016088.0</td><td>My dog is gone</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Gone to the Snow Dogs</td><td>2022195.0</td><td>my dog is gone</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The Pet Collective</td><td>2045301.0</td><td>my kittens were on the wardrobe and just shoving things off it like this my spot get off</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Cole & Marmalade</td><td>2046306.0</td><td>Yesterday my cat broke my favorite vase. naughty little turd</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Steff J</td><td>2052571.0</td><td>My dog goes through that it doesnt last but a hour its sad but its life</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The Dodo</td><td>2080942.0</td><td>I should probably make these for my dogs but would it be ok if I do not use food colouring</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>2108003.0</td><td>im going to do this with my doggo‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>The Dodo</td><td>2119473.0</td><td>My cat loves to sit on my ipad</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Jackson Galaxy</td><td>2119652.0</td><td>These people dont deserve this kitty.

Also what heart & liver do you use does it have to be chicken. Where I live there are no local butchers for miles so most will have to be bought from a supermarket nor can my budget stretch to organic. Also do you add all the egg to the food as I read you are only meant to add yolk? Also I cant afford a grinder so is it safe to cut larger bones up or just use a mallet ?

We took him to the vet and he was put on fluids. They told us the cancer had most likely spread to his brain and he would have 2 weeks to live. We were devastated and my parents didnt want to spend money on any treatments so we took him home and were given phenobarbital for the seizures. As a last ditch effort we decided to change him onto a holistic diet. More than 2 weeks had passed and he was acting normal again but my stoner brother wanted to try CBD/THC oil to ease his pain.  That was the best decision we ever made. My dog used to have big tumors that would get punctured and bleed everywhere but we didnt want to put him through more surgeries to remove them and about 3 months after we started the oil the tumors started to shrink.  Now the only visible tumors are little ones on his tongue. I truly believe the cancer has gone into remission and Im so thankful my dog is still here and loving life. His 7th birthday is November 24th!!! I didnt think he would live as long as he has.  I definitely recommend the CBD and/or THC oil.  Going into this I did not think it would cure his cancer but it almost seems as if it has!

Hes so big hes just nudging her with his face and knocking her to the ground.  POWERFUL dog.  So Im trying to get us away but also trying to stop this fucking thing from possibly impregnating my dog.  Im a big guy but physically couldnt do a god damn thing about it.  Im sure at this point my dogs probably going to get seriously hurt and Im probably going to have to fight this thing off as well.    So around 12 minutes after it first charges at us and me shouting for anyone to help. (In in the middle of nowhere)  It just stops...

Hes a little under 2yrs old but he knows he should not bite... that just doesnt stop him lol. If hes playing with a toy that youre holding hell commonly try to bite the toy as closely as possible to your hand (you can feel the side of his teeth) but you can tell hes trying to not actively bite your hand. Eventually hell get frustrated enough and aim exclusively for your hand ignoring the toy completely. He still wants to play just not with the toy... just your hand lol. He learned to be careful about biting when hes getting treats though.The biggest problem for me is how he doesnt do well with people we are engaging with. Taking him for walks or drives hes usually okay with people passing by him. Doesnt bark wildly or anything but maybe hes curious about smell. If friends/family come over though we bring him to the groomers or to the vet hes a mad dog that will try to bite viciously if you approach him and were around. Apparently if we leave him for a little while (were not with him for at least 10min) hes almost like an angel the rest of the time. Not sure how to remedy his initial anger. Like hes in full defense mode and will even try to bite us. I guess it should also be noted he has a temper waking up or when hes sleepy. You cant try to carry him if hes lying down in that state otherwise hell try to viciously/wildly bite your hands. Likewise just petting him during those times. Hell start to flash his teeth and then bite if youre not careful. You can pretend youre trying to play with him though and when he shifts a little hes okay to be picked up. Hes usually not like that at all when hes awake though (outside of the ferocity hes at in those other cases though like the groomers or vet).</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Vet Ranch</td><td>2065544.0</td><td>my dogs name is Oliver</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Loki the Red Fox</td><td>2074085.0</td><td>Loki is just like my dog! he goes after anything moving! its a pain when you are trying to make a bed!</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Zak Georges Dog Training rEvolution</td><td>2106401.0</td><td>I love your book and videos and also have a 3 month old Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.

She is a great field mice catcher and ground squirrel catcher. She avoids all people except my husband my youngest adult child and myself.

I get her in a couple of weeks and I intend to follow what Ive learned from your videos.Thank very much.</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>757235.0</td><td>My cats were going crazy while I was watching this ahah</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Taylor Nicole Dean</td><td>757235.0</td><td>Sampson for the boy and Sylvia for the girl.

Ive been able to teach him the basics but have faced problems fixing his destructive behaviour and whining.Ive a tiny mix breed puppy 8 months old but he has never ending energy even though he hardly eats(he just smells food and goes away) and we play with him a lot apart from two 2 kilometre walks a day. Ive tried tiring him up everyday but still he constantly craves for attention and when he gets that he wants to scratch and bite. Moreover if you do not pay attention to him hell start whining and can go on for half and hour or so. But the most troublesome part is his destructive behaviour. When we usually go out even for 15 ministers or so he starts tearing the wallpaper the bed covers and recently the wooden bathroom doors. Not only that but when we are home and not paying attention to him he makes a meal out of our flip flops and in one case my wifes watch! Weve tried everything from buying toys to treating him to making him wear a muzzle but he somehow always manages to destroy things.The worse part about it is the fact that he is well aware of his behaviour being unacceptable. As soon as I notice his recent destruction he starts shaking in fear but never stops tearing the house. Please give me some tips and suggestions on the situation. Itll be helpful.</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Peter Caine Dog Training</td><td>2509003.0</td><td>Petco trainers are mean my friend told me they told her to put pennies in a monster energy drink can and shake it to get the dogs attention they told her to get her dog on blue Buffalo it was recalled and her dog died within a week it was very sad she shouldnt have had the dog in the first place she didnt have the means to care for him the shelter threw it on her because he was gonna be put down she wanted a dog to service her but she didnt qualify for a service dog I met her through her dog my boss told me she would ban access of my service dog if I didnt train hers her dog was a boxer ridge back this dog was out of control he humped my dog in the face just a total goof but I finally did train him after seeing her try to go through pet co and seeing what they do I dont do dog food I do a raw diet for my dogs but she wasnt interested and it wasnt my dog to make her change her mind she doesnt have a animal anymore and I dont think she will ever get another after he died it was emoitional even for me his organs shut down with in a week and he died</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>ViralHog</td><td>2514921.0</td><td>If that was my cat Id surround him with cucumbers while he sleeps üòÇüòÇ</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>2527729.0</td><td>Me : *puts on dogs barking vid*My dog : *Snaps phone from hand*Me : AYYY!!!</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Dogumentary TV</td><td>83868.0</td><td>Im looking for a emotional support dog and I love the doberman breed.

I have been ill this past year and havent been following instagram or posting much but was wondering how Seymore was doing.  To see that you also have Sabrina is awesome. Gidget is doing great but we found out that she has a malformation in her jaw and lacks the ability to open nuts and seeds. Her physical issues require that I cut all her food small and open all her nuts and seeds. Ive found that a quick smash of a hammer breaks everything up but still requires her to work to get to the meat of the nuts and seeds. Unfortunately she is unable to be released as she now relies on me to prep her food. When my puppy found her in the yard at maybe 18 days old I committed to caring for her as long as she needed...if that means her entire life thats just fine. I dont feel wildlife should ever be caged and made into pets but sometimes they need our help. I have agreed to help rehab another orphan that a couple found in their yard and I am hoping after winter we can start the soft release process on my property. I live in an area where I can release them into the woods but also provide back-up shelter and food if they choose to stay close. Its a commitment like having a dog or cat but its so rewarding. Gidget is very domesticated now and lives a life where she is not caged 24/7 and has an entire room dedicated to her. She pretends to be a squirrel 90% of the time but she also loves to snuggle and play with her humans. The puppy that found her thinks that she is her puppy and they are very bonded to each other.  While she is super comfy with me and 2 of my dogs she is still very fearful of other humans and dogs...I have to limit my pet sitting now because it upsets her and she will hide for the duration of company visits.  Sabrina and Seymore are so lucky to have a caring human that chose to help them as opposed to euthanizing them...which was what I was told to do with Gidget. Even when the vet suggested it when he discovered why she couldnt Crack or open nuts I explained and promised her that I would care for her as long as she needed me...this spring we may allow her to spend some time in an outdoor enclosure that we will be building this winter for the new squirrel. We will revisit release options for Gidget once the threat of Winter is behind us. Unless I provide all her food and she doesnt leave the property she wont survive because she probably doesnt know how to defend herself...so...I doubt that will ever be an option for her...but she might enjoy hanging out in an enclosure where she is safe. For now Ill continue to prep her food daily and allow her to run the house and spend her time hanging out on one of her several 7ft tall cat trees and her huge 6x6x24 cage with 3 levels and swings and her pick of about 6 different nests Ive set up all over the house....can you say SPOILED SQUIRREL PRINCESS GIDGET???</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>best pets</td><td>2442520.0</td><td>I love border collies my dog Polly is a lab and she is not the smartest dog but she learned to sit and lay down easily</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>2444559.0</td><td>Maybe on your 100000 subs you should do a vlog with gohan??

Ive gotta add my two cents if you dont mind.I have to applaud your video I think it is very educational.I agree partly with the whole Youre breaking the law by bringing a dog thats not service trained into the store Thing but I also understand why you did it and I think its important that you did.BECAUSE people should keep in mind that your dog WAS in fact acting unlike a SD in the ways you stated: He was pulling at the leash showing interest in other people and not focusing on you. He did NOT however approach other dogs or pay much attention to them and I could tell that you redirected him by not even going near other pets in the store.By the way that one VERY dedicated commenter; it is not illegal to confront someone about their SD even if you are a citizen. If you believe the animal is not acting the way a service dog must in this example a retractable leash and the dog going wherever it wanted you have every right to ask the same question anyone else can: Is that a service dog? and What services does he perform? You can ask other questions (not advised and rude) but if someone cant answer either of those two (They dont have to of course but it is illegal to LIE about it) then it prooobably isnt a service dog.I consider it my responsibility as a citizen to keep myself and ESPECIALLY those with real SDs safe in this way; it is a right.Sorry @Gage OBrien about the long winded-ness but I really appreciate your video and hope you continue to make more on educated such as these.

You can train an animal without hurting them with positive reenforcement and lots of attention. Give them breaks from training or working when they need one! Ive had dogs my whole life. I dont beat my pups when they do something wrong. Ive taught them the word no. I use that when they do something they shouldnt with a very small tap on the rear end just enough so they connect the bad action with me being disappointed and never hard. Ive never shoved my dogs face in urine or anything. I successfully trained my two adult dogs who now live with my dad because hes retired and wanted something to keep him active I trained my brothers dog with him and Im training my two new pups the same as I always have-brief show of disapproval and then forgiveness. A pup their age can only know what theyre in trouble for at max about 20 minutes. Id rather positively show them not doing the specific action reaps a reward where doing the action means Im disappointed. When they do the opposite of the bad thing-they get a treat. Which backs up the I should do this because she likes when I do this enough to give me food and pets and belly rubs! Mind set. And the she DOESNT like that at all. I didnt get a treat and shes not petting me...and I was told to lay down and stay for doing that thing...maybe I shouldnt do it. Thought. Just like beating a kid doesnt really get you anything (but a case) where as showing the kid with them having a positive result in what you expect (school behavior sharing whatever youre teaching) reaps a reward. When my nieces behave well in the store with me (all under 8) they can pick out a juice or flavored water they want. But not behaving means no juices or flavored water. It only takes a warning for them to decide theyd rather behave and get something they want over misbehaving and not getting want they want.</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Dodo</td><td>1074972.0</td><td>The idiots who have never seen an actual dog kill something versus me over here whos dog will do it for fun-the difference is I KNOW this dog wasnt going to harm it.

She chases it down bites its throat and walks away once its dead. Shes also killed birds bats groundhogs and cats. She doesnt play with nor rescue anything. Why she can only have one companion dog larger than her around (shes a mountain cur/chow mix) or she will try and bully it. There was ONE other dog she was fond of-a small very sweet chihuahua she never harmed. Thats it. She would lick the ears of the chihuahua even though she wasnt use to being around other dogs or not wanting to harm something. She did it on instinct. Now she does it with the GS/Husky mix.

The work you are doing about animal abuse that some people describe as training is second to none. I would ask thought that you find another phrase besides balanced trainers because not all trainers who use some sort of negative reinforcement fall into the category that you created when you show ABUSIVE TRAINERS. I personally do not use compulsion to train my dogs but I have in a setting that does not qualify as training. Just to be clear I rarely but occasionally correct my dog in everyday life when my training with them is not complete or if I know that they know what Im talking about but are testing boundaries. After all they are living creatures with brains so they will occasionally test boundaries. And again just to clarify I DONT HIT OR CAUSE ANY SERIOUS PAIN. I only use to get the attention of the dog.

One thing I love about them is how sensitive and loyal/caring they are to our emotions and feelings. My cats get all cuddly when they feel me stressed or upset and Ive heard many sweet stories of other animals picking up on our emotions and showing love. Anyways Its ok to ask for help.

As I watched your video I laughed because my sisters dog Bella a Labradoodle has some of the behaviors of your special girl Brante. Bella wants to play all the time and she will swim in the pool for hours fetching and returning frisbees and balls. Its odd for me to encounter a dog who looks like a poodle behave more like a working dog such as the Lab that is inside her. Mals are beautiful and purposeful and youve made a perfect video demonstrating the pros and cons of owning such a majestic breed. I would have made the same mistakes in training as you had made because I would just want to hug her too! I hug all my dogs because as you said I love them.I recently lost Mia my precious German Shepherd I rescued 11 years ago. She had the uncanny determination powerful will and heightened intelligence of your Brante. There were a myriad amount of fascinating attributes that I discovered about Mia. However during her explosive bouts of play she was very gentle with me. Giving her the football or pointedly feeding her a snack from my hand she was very mindful that my hand being close to her mouth and gently took the food without ever biting my fingers. She knew the difference between the food and my hand. Sometimes She would allow me to drop the food into her mouth. When you spoke about losing your dog of 15 years I understand how you feel. It is abundantly clear that you are a kindred spirit. Thank you for making this video and if she will allow please give Brante a hug from me. üêïüêæüíï</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Steel The Husky</td><td>1953428.0</td><td>I got my dog that same toy awhile ago she never took squirrels out not really but she did basically destroy the house  the sides of it she made holes and stuffing is coming out everywhere and plays with everything separately but the squirrels she loves they are still one with no holes but the house well yeah</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Brian Barczyk</td><td>2016088.0</td><td>My dog is gone</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Gone to the Snow Dogs</td><td>2022195.0</td><td>my dog is gone</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Pet Collective</td><td>2045301.0</td><td>my kittens were on the wardrobe and just shoving things off it like this my spot get off</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Cole & Marmalade</td><td>2046306.0</td><td>Yesterday my cat broke my favorite vase. naughty little turd</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>Steff J</td><td>2052571.0</td><td>My dog goes through that it doesnt last but a hour its sad but its life</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Dodo</td><td>2080942.0</td><td>I should probably make these for my dogs but would it be ok if I do not use food colouring</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Gohan The Husky</td><td>2108003.0</td><td>im going to do this with my doggo‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>The Dodo</td><td>2119473.0</td><td>My cat loves to sit on my ipad</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Jackson Galaxy</td><td>2119652.0</td><td>These people dont deserve this kitty.

Also what heart & liver do you use does it have to be chicken. Where I live there are no local butchers for miles so most will have to be bought from a supermarket nor can my budget stretch to organic. Also do you add all the egg to the food as I read you are only meant to add yolk? Also I cant afford a grinder so is it safe to cut larger bones up or just use a mallet ?
